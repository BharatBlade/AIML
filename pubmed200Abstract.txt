In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in 
autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many 
scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new 
technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a 
regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different 
organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding 
acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular 
eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and 
interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers 
to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on 
these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, 
because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being 
asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for 
every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor 
autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the 
autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes 
(canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to 
block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes 
that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, 
because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular 
pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker 
for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods 
of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our 
ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the 
field.

Objective: To describe the evaluation and management of hypoglycemia in patients 
without diabetes mellitus. Methods: Review of the literature for the evaluation 
and management of non-diabetic hypoglycemia using Medline and PubMed. Results: 
Hypoglycemia (glucose <55 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L]) is uncommon in people without 
diabetes. Whipple’s triad (low plasma glucose concentration, clinical 
signs/symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, and resolution of signs or symptoms 
when the plasma glucose concentration increases) should be documented in 
patients prior to initiating an evaluation. Medications should be reviewed. 
Critical illnesses, malnutrition, hormone deficiencies especially adrenal 
insufficiency, and non-islet cell tumors secreting IGF-II need be considered in 
those who are ill. Hypoglycemia can also follow bariatric surgery. In apparently 
healthy individuals, endogenous hyperinsulinism due to insulinoma, functional 
β-cell disorders, or the insulin autoimmune syndrome are possible, as are 
accidental, surreptitious or factitious causes of hypoglycemia. Tests performed 
during hypoglycemia can establish the cause in those whom illness or medications 
are excluded. Testing should be done at the time of spontaneous development of 
symptoms. If this is not possible, it can be done in the setting of a prolonged 
supervised fast or during a mixed meal test. Endogenous hyperinsulinism is 
supported by insulin ≥3 uU/mL, c-peptide ≥0.2 nmol/L, proinsulin ≥5 pmol/L, 
β-hydroxybutyrate ≤2.7 mmol/L and undetectable sulfonylurea/meglitinide in the 
setting of hypoglycemia. The use of glucagon tolerance tests, c-peptide 
suppression tests, anti-insulin antibody testing, and continuous glucose 
monitoring are discussed. Congenital causes of hypoglycemia, diagnosed primarily 
in neonates and children, are also reviewed. Treatment of hypoglycemia is 
tailored to the etiology. Conclusions: Accurate diagnosis is needed to direct 
nutritional, medical, and/or surgical treatment for non-diabetic hypoglycemia.

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex and heterogeneous 
neurodevelopmental condition for which curative treatments are lacking. Whilst 
pharmacological treatments are generally effective and safe, there is 
considerable inter-individual variability among patients regarding treatment 
response, required dose, and tolerability. Many of the non-pharmacological 
treatments, which are preferred to drug-treatment by some patients, either lack 
efficacy for core symptoms or are associated with small effect sizes. No 
evidence-based decision tools are currently available to allocate 
pharmacological or psychosocial treatments based on the patient's clinical, 
environmental, cognitive, genetic, or biological characteristics. We 
systematically reviewed potential biomarkers that may help in diagnosing ADHD 
and/or stratifying ADHD into more homogeneous subgroups and/or predict clinical 
course, treatment response, and long-term outcome across the lifespan. Most work 
involved exploratory studies with cognitive, actigraphic and EEG diagnostic 
markers to predict ADHD, along with relatively few studies exploring markers to 
subtype ADHD and predict response to treatment. There is a critical need for 
multisite prospective carefully designed experimentally controlled or 
observational studies to identify biomarkers that index inter-individual 
variability and/or predict treatment response.

Schizophrenia has a heritability of 60-80%1, much of which is attributable to 
common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 
76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report 
common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were 
concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of 
the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using 
fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 
protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, 
including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region 
variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, 
including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped 
candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding 
variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit 
GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated 
by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological 
processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common 
and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; 
and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic 
studies.

    Science. 2018 Sep 28;361(6409):1323-1324.

Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and 
often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We 
quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide 
association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and 
assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. 
Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders 
appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We 
also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain 
phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to 
explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic 
heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the 
importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and 
the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.

Somatic hotspot mutations and structural amplifications and fusions that affect 
fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (encoded by FGFR2) occur in multiple types 
of cancer1. However, clinical responses to FGFR inhibitors have remained 
variable1-9, emphasizing the need to better understand which FGFR2 alterations 
are oncogenic and therapeutically targetable. Here we apply transposon-based 
screening10,11 and tumour modelling in mice12,13, and find that the truncation 
of exon 18 (E18) of Fgfr2 is a potent driver mutation. Human oncogenomic 
datasets revealed a diverse set of FGFR2 alterations, including rearrangements, 
E1-E17 partial amplifications, and E18 nonsense and frameshift mutations, each 
causing the transcription of E18-truncated FGFR2 (FGFR2ΔE18). Functional in 
vitro and in vivo examination of a compendium of FGFR2ΔE18 and full-length 
variants pinpointed FGFR2-E18 truncation as single-driver alteration in cancer. 
By contrast, the oncogenic competence of FGFR2 full-length amplifications 
depended on a distinct landscape of cooperating driver genes. This suggests that 
genomic alterations that generate stable FGFR2ΔE18 variants are actionable 
therapeutic targets, which we confirmed in preclinical mouse and human tumour 
models, and in a clinical trial. We propose that cancers containing any FGFR2 
variant with a truncated E18 should be considered for FGFR-targeted therapies.

This review summarizes the last decade of work by the ENIGMA (Enhancing 
NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Consortium, a global alliance of 
over 1400 scientists across 43 countries, studying the human brain in health and 
disease. Building on large-scale genetic studies that discovered the first 
robustly replicated genetic loci associated with brain metrics, ENIGMA has 
diversified into over 50 working groups (WGs), pooling worldwide data and 
expertise to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience, psychiatry, 
neurology, and genetics. Most ENIGMA WGs focus on specific psychiatric and 
neurological conditions, other WGs study normal variation due to sex and gender 
differences, or development and aging; still other WGs develop methodological 
pipelines and tools to facilitate harmonized analyses of "big data" (i.e., 
genetic and epigenetic data, multimodal MRI, and electroencephalography data). 
These international efforts have yielded the largest neuroimaging studies to 
date in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, 
epilepsy, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. More recent ENIGMA WGs have formed to 
study anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and behavior, sleep and insomnia, 
eating disorders, irritability, brain injury, antisocial personality and conduct 
disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Here, we summarize the first 
decade of ENIGMA's activities and ongoing projects, and describe the successes 
and challenges encountered along the way. We highlight the advantages of 
collaborative large-scale coordinated data analyses for testing reproducibility 
and robustness of findings, offering the opportunity to identify brain systems 
involved in clinical syndromes across diverse samples and associated genetic, 
environmental, demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors.

BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and nonfatal suicide 
attempts, which occur far more frequently, are a major source of disability and 
social and economic burden. Both have substantial genetic etiology, which is 
partially shared and partially distinct from that of related psychiatric 
disorders.
METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,782 suicide 
attempt (SA) cases and 519,961 controls in the International Suicide Genetics 
Consortium (ISGC). The GWAS of SA was conditioned on psychiatric disorders using 
GWAS summary statistics via multitrait-based conditional and joint analysis, to 
remove genetic effects on SA mediated by psychiatric disorders. We investigated 
the shared and divergent genetic architectures of SA, psychiatric disorders, and 
other known risk factors.
RESULTS: Two loci reached genome-wide significance for SA: the major 
histocompatibility complex and an intergenic locus on chromosome 7, the latter 
of which remained associated with SA after conditioning on psychiatric disorders 
and replicated in an independent cohort from the Million Veteran Program. This 
locus has been implicated in risk-taking behavior, smoking, and insomnia. SA 
showed strong genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, particularly major 
depression, and also with smoking, pain, risk-taking behavior, sleep 
disturbances, lower educational attainment, reproductive traits, lower 
socioeconomic status, and poorer general health. After conditioning on 
psychiatric disorders, the genetic correlations between SA and psychiatric 
disorders decreased, whereas those with nonpsychiatric traits remained largely 
unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify a risk locus that contributes more strongly to 
SA than other phenotypes and suggest a shared underlying biology between SA and 
known risk factors that is not mediated by psychiatric disorders.

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with approximately 1% 
lifetime risk globally. Large-scale schizophrenia genetic studies have reported 
primarily on European ancestry samples, potentially missing important biological 
insights. Here, we report the largest study to date of East Asian participants 
(22,778 schizophrenia cases and 35,362 controls), identifying 21 
genome-wide-significant associations in 19 genetic loci. Common genetic variants 
that confer risk for schizophrenia have highly similar effects between East 
Asian and European ancestries (genetic correlation = 0.98 ± 0.03), indicating 
that the genetic basis of schizophrenia and its biology are broadly shared 
across populations. A fixed-effect meta-analysis including individuals from East 
Asian and European ancestries identified 208 significant associations in 176 
genetic loci (53 novel). Trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduced the sets of 
candidate causal variants in 44 loci. Polygenic risk scores had reduced 
performance when transferred across ancestries, highlighting the importance of 
including sufficient samples of major ancestral groups to ensure their 
generalizability across populations.

IMPORTANCE: Recognition that adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) is common, seriously impairing, and usually undiagnosed has led to the 
development of adult ADHD screening scales for use in community, workplace, and 
primary care settings. However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV 
criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria.
OBJECTIVES: To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating 
characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD 
Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Probability subsamples of participants in 2 
general population surveys (2001-2003 household survey [n = 119] and 2004-2005 
managed care subscriber survey [n = 218]) who completed the full 29-question 
self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, 
were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for 
DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, 
a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with 
optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied 
to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The 
accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011-2012 
clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University 
Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015-2016 primary 
care controls (n = 300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to 
September 22, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve 
(AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS.
RESULTS: Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0%) household survey respondents, 
51 (23.4%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7%) NYU Langone respondents met 
DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the 
respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9%); mean 
(SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be 
optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples. Operating 
characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold in the weighted (to 
the 8.2% DSM-5/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population prevalence) data 
(sensitivity, 91.4%; specificity, 96.0%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3%). Operating 
characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7%) when the 
scale was applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9%; 
specificity, 74.0%; AUC, 0.83; PPV, 82.8%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, 
detects the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also 
has high specificity and PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty 
treatment settings.

Purpose: To define the genetic landscape of advanced differentiated and 
anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and identify genetic alterations of potential 
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance.Experimental Design: The 
genetic profiles of 583 advanced differentiated and 196 ATCs generated with 
targeted next-generation sequencing cancer-associated gene panels MSK-IMPACT and 
FoundationOne were analyzed.Results: ATC had more genetic alterations per tumor, 
and pediatric papillary thyroid cancer had fewer genetic alterations per tumor 
when compared with other thyroid cancer types. DNA mismatch repair deficit and 
activity of APOBEC cytidine deaminases were identified as mechanisms associated 
with high mutational burden in a subset of differentiated thyroid cancers and 
ATCs. Copy number losses and mutations of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, amplification of 
CCNE1, amplification of receptor tyrosine kinase genes KDR, KIT, and PDGFRA, 
amplification of immune evasion genes CD274, PDCD1LG2, and JAK2, and activating 
point mutations in small GTPase RAC1 were associated with ATC. An association of 
KDR, KIT, and PDGFRA amplification with the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells 
to lenvatinib was shown in vitro Three genetically distinct types of ATCs are 
proposed.Conclusions: This large-scale analysis describes genetic alterations in 
a cohort of thyroid cancers enriched in advanced cases. Many novel genetic 
events previously not seen in thyroid cancer were found. Genetic alterations 
associated with anaplastic transformation were identified. An updated schematic 
of thyroid cancer genetic evolution is proposed. Clin Cancer Res; 24(13);

Cancer treatments have evolved from indiscriminate cytotoxic agents to selective 
genome- and immune-targeted drugs that have transformed the outcomes of some 
malignancies1. Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the 'precision 
medicine' paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to 
the individual patient2-6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on 
molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7-14. Several of these trials 
have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5-10% range15, and 
low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene 
panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or 
the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be 
implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination 
therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a 
first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective 
study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675 ) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely 
recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We 
found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 
49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a 
larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher 'matching 
score', was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as 
well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to 
targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current 
clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation 
with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and 
heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents.

Wilson disease or hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive 
disease which results in an excess copper build up in the body. It primarily 
affects the liver and basal ganglia of the brain, but it can affect other organ 
systems too. Symptoms usually are related to the brain and liver. Liver-related 
symptoms include vomiting, weakness, ascites, swelling of the legs, yellowish 
skin, and itchiness. Brain or neurological symptoms include tremors, muscle 
stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and auditory or 
visual hallucinations. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive condition caused 
by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be 
affected,  a copy of the gene from each parent need to be inherited. Diagnosis 
is difficult and involves blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy along 
with the clinical evaluation. Genetic testing may be used to screen the family 
members of those affected. The genetic defect is localized to long arm of 
chromosome 13 (13q), which has been shown to alter the copper transporting ATP 
gene in the liver. The majority of patients with Wilson disease present within 
the first decade of life with liver dysfunction. The neuropsychiatric features 
are seen in the third/fourth decade of life. Wilson disease is rare but if not 
recognized and treated, it is fatal.

Viruses have brought humanity many challenges: respiratory infection, cancer, 
neurological impairment and immunosuppression to name a few. Virology research 
over the last 60+ years has responded to reduce this disease burden with 
vaccines and antivirals. Despite this long history, the COVID-19 pandemic has 
brought unprecedented attention to the field of virology. Some of this attention 
is focused on concern about the safe conduct of research with human pathogens. A 
small but vocal group of individuals has seized upon these concerns - conflating 
legitimate questions about safely conducting virus-related research with 
uncertainties over the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The result has fueled public 
confusion and, in many instances, ill-informed condemnation of virology. With 
this article, we seek to promote a return to rational discourse. We explain the 
use of gain-of-function approaches in science, discuss the possible origins of 
SARS-CoV-2 and outline current regulatory structures that provide oversight for 
virological research in the United States. By offering our expertise, we - a 
broad group of working virologists - seek to aid policy makers in navigating 
these controversial issues. Balanced, evidence-based discourse is essential to 
addressing public concern while maintaining and expanding much-needed research 
in virology.

Precision medicine has transformed the way urothelial carcinoma is managed. 
However, current practices are limited by the availability of tissue samples for 
genomic profiling and the spatial and temporal molecular heterogeneity observed 
in many studies. Among rapidly advancing genomic sequencing technologies, 
non-invasive liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool to 
reproduce tumour genomics, and has shown potential to be integrated in several 
aspects of clinical care. In urothelial carcinoma, liquid biopsies such as 
plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and urinary tumour DNA (utDNA) have been 
investigated as a surrogates for tumour biopsies and might bridge many 
shortfalls currently faced by clinicians. Both ctDNA and utDNA seem really 
promising in urothelial carcinoma diagnosis, staging and prognosis, response to 
therapy monitoring, detection of minimal residual disease and surveillance. The 
use of liquid biopsies in patients with urothelial carcinoma could further 
advance precision medicine in this population, facilitating personalized patient 
monitoring through non-invasive assays.

Hypoglycemia is uncommon in people who are not being treated for diabetes 
mellitus. Low blood glucose concentrations lead to adrenergic activation and 
neuroglycopenia (Table 1). Symptomatic hypoglycemia is diagnosed clinically 
using Whipple’s triad: symptoms of hypoglycemia, plasma glucose concentration<55 
mg/dl (3.0 mmol/l), and resolution of those symptoms after the plasma glucose 
concentration is raised. Capillary blood glucose measurements should not be used 
in the evaluation of hypoglycemia due to poor accuracy.

Objective: To describe testing indications and protocols for the evaluation of 
pancreatic islet function. Methods: A review of the literature and consensus 
guidelines concerning testing of pancreatic islet function was performed. 
Results: Indications for screening for diabetes mellitus are reviewed. 
Diagnostic criteria for diagnosis are fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 
mmol/l) or random glucose ≥200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) with hyperglycemic symptoms, 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5%, and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) 2-h 
glucose ≥200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) after 75 g of glucose. One-step and two-step 
strategies for diagnosing gestational diabetes using pregnancy-specific criteria 
as well as use of the 2-h 75-g OGTT for the postpartum testing of women with 
gestational diabetes (4-12 weeks after delivery) are described. Testing for 
other forms of diabetes with unique features are reviewed, including the 
recommendation to use the 2-h 75 g OGTT to screen for cystic fibrosis-related 
diabetes and post-transplantation diabetes, fasting glucose test for HIV 
positive individuals, and genetic testing for monogenic diabetes syndromes 
including neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). 
Elevated measurements of pancreatic islet autoantibodies (e.g., to the 65-KDa 
isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), tyrosine phosphatase related 
islet antigen 2 (IA-2), insulin (IAA), and zinc transporter (ZnT8)) suggest 
autoimmune type 1 diabetes (vs type 2 diabetes). IAA is primarily measured in 
youth. The use of autoantibody testing in diabetes screening programs are 
recommended only in first degree relatives of an individual with type 1 diabetes 
or in research protocols. C-peptide measurements >3 years after clinician 
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in adults can be helpful in identifying those who 
have type 1 diabetes (low or undetectable c-peptide) from those who may have 
type 2 or monogenic diabetes. Use of OGTTs to examine insulin secretory reserve 
and intravenous glucose tolerance testing are also reviewed. These tests are 
primarily used in research studies. Evaluation of glycemic control is discussed, 
with special attention to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and its correlation with mean 
blood glucose levels as well as assays of other glycated serum proteins. 
Finally, protocols used to evaluate hypoglycemia (glucose < 55 mg/dl (3.1 
mmol/l)) are described, such as the supervised prolonged fast, during which 
measurements of glucose, insulin, c-peptide, oral insulin secretagogues, 
proinsulin, and beta-hydroxybutyrate are obtained. Insulinoma is suggested by 
elevated insulin, proinsulin and c-peptide levels, beta-hydroxybutyrate < 2.7 
mmol/l, and undetectable insulin secretagogues. Use of a modified OGTT in the 
evaluation of the dumping syndrome is also described, as are the mixed meal 
test, glucagon tolerance test, c-peptide suppression test and evaluation of 
autoimmune hypoglycemia. For complete coverage of all related areas of

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a devastating mental disorder with poorly defined 
underlying molecular mechanisms. The gut microbiome can modulate brain function 
and behaviors through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Here, we found that 
unmedicated and medicated patients with SCZ had a decreased microbiome 
α-diversity index and marked disturbances of gut microbial composition versus 
healthy controls (HCs). Several unique bacterial taxa (e.g., Veillonellaceae and 
Lachnospiraceae) were associated with SCZ severity. A specific microbial panel 
(Aerococcaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Brucellaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and 
Rikenellaceae) enabled discriminating patients with SCZ from HCs with 0.769 area 
under the curve. Compared to HCs, germ-free mice receiving SCZ microbiome fecal 
transplants had lower glutamate and higher glutamine and GABA in the hippocampus 
and displayed SCZ-relevant behaviors similar to other mouse models of SCZ 
involving glutamatergic hypofunction. Together, our findings suggest that the 
SCZ microbiome itself can alter neurochemistry and neurologic function in ways 
that may be relevant to SCZ pathology.

IMPORTANCE: No clinically applicable diagnostic test exists for severe mental 
disorders. Lipids harbor potential as disease markers.
OBJECTIVE: To define a reproducible profile of lipid alterations in the blood 
plasma of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) independent of demographic and 
environmental variables and to investigate its specificity in association with 
other psychiatric disorders, ie, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar 
disorder (BPD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicohort case-control 
diagnostic analysis involving plasma samples from psychiatric patients and 
control individuals collected between July 17, 2009, and May 18, 2018. Study 
participants were recruited as consecutive and volunteer samples at multiple 
inpatient and outpatient mental health hospitals in Western Europe (Germany and 
Austria [DE-AT]), China (CN), and Russia (RU). Individuals with DSM-IV or 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision diagnoses of SCZ, MDD, BPD, or a first psychotic 
episode, as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls without a mental 
health-related diagnosis were included in the study. Samples and data were 
analyzed from January 2018 to September 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Plasma lipidome composition was assessed using 
liquid chromatography coupled with untargeted mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Blood lipid levels were assessed in 980 individuals (mean [SD] age, 36 
[13] years; 510 male individuals [52%]) diagnosed with SCZ, BPD, MDD, or those 
with a first psychotic episode and in 572 controls (mean [SD] age, 34 [13] 
years; 323 male individuals [56%]). A total of 77 lipids were found to be 
significantly altered between those with SCZ (n = 436) and controls (n = 478) in 
all 3 sample cohorts. Alterations were consistent between cohorts (CN and RU: 
[Pearson correlation] r = 0.75; DE-AT and CN: r = 0.78; DE-AT and RU: r = 0.82; 
P < 10-38). A lipid-based predictive model separated patients with SCZ from 
controls with high diagnostic ability (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve = 0.86-0.95). Lipidome alterations in BPD and MDD, assessed 
in 184 and 256 individuals, respectively, were found to be similar to those of 
SCZ (BPD: r = 0.89; MDD: r = 0.92; P < 10-79). Assessment of detected 
alterations in individuals with a first psychotic episode, as well as patients 
with SCZ not receiving medication, demonstrated only limited association with 
medication restricted to particular lipids.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, SCZ was accompanied by a reproducible 
profile of plasma lipidome alterations, not associated with symptom severity, 
medication, and demographic and environmental variables, and largely shared with 
BPD and MDD. This lipid alteration signature may represent a trait marker of 
severe psychiatric disorders, indicating its potential to be transformed into a 
clinically applicable testing procedure.

BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have shown structural alterations in several 
brain regions in children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). Through the formation of the international ENIGMA ADHD Working 
Group, we aimed to address weaknesses of previous imaging studies and 
meta-analyses, namely inadequate sample size and methodological heterogeneity. 
We aimed to investigate whether there are structural differences in children and 
adults with ADHD compared with those without this diagnosis.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional mega-analysis, we used the data from the 
international ENIGMA Working Group collaboration, which in the present analysis 
was frozen at Feb 8, 2015. Individual sites analysed structural T1-weighted MRI 
brain scans with harmonised protocols of individuals with ADHD compared with 
those who do not have this diagnosis. Our primary outcome was to assess 
case-control differences in subcortical structures and intracranial volume 
through pooling of all individual data from all cohorts in this collaboration. 
For this analysis, p values were significant at the false discovery rate 
corrected threshold of p=0·0156.
FINDINGS: Our sample comprised 1713 participants with ADHD and 1529 controls 
from 23 sites with a median age of 14 years (range 4-63 years). The volumes of 
the accumbens (Cohen's d=-0·15), amygdala (d=-0·19), caudate (d=-0·11), 
hippocampus (d=-0·11), putamen (d=-0·14), and intracranial volume (d=-0·10) were 
smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls in the mega-analysis. 
There was no difference in volume size in the pallidum (p=0·95) and thalamus 
(p=0·39) between people with ADHD and controls. Exploratory lifespan modelling 
suggested a delay of maturation and a delay of degeneration, as effect sizes 
were highest in most subgroups of children (<15 years) versus adults (>21 
years): in the accumbens (Cohen's d=-0·19 vs -0·10), amygdala (d=-0·18 vs 
-0·14), caudate (d=-0·13 vs -0·07), hippocampus (d=-0·12 vs -0·06), putamen 
(d=-0·18 vs -0·08), and intracranial volume (d=-0·14 vs 0·01). There was no 
difference between children and adults for the pallidum (p=0·79) or thalamus 
(p=0·89). Case-control differences in adults were non-significant (all p>0·03). 
Psychostimulant medication use (all p>0·15) or symptom scores (all p>0·02) did 
not influence results, nor did the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders 
(all p>0·5).
INTERPRETATION: With the largest dataset to date, we add new knowledge about 
bilateral amygdala, accumbens, and hippocampus reductions in ADHD. We extend the 
brain maturation delay theory for ADHD to include subcortical structures and 
refute medication effects on brain volume suggested by earlier meta-analyses. 
Lifespan analyses suggest that, in the absence of well powered longitudinal 
studies, the ENIGMA cross-sectional sample across six decades of ages provides a 
means to generate hypotheses about lifespan trajectories in brain phenotypes.

Although somatic mutations in Histone 3.3 (H3.3) are well-studied drivers of 
oncogenesis, the role of germline mutations remains unreported. We analyze 46 
patients bearing de novo germline mutations in histone 3 family 3A (H3F3A) or 
H3F3B with progressive neurologic dysfunction and congenital anomalies without 
malignancies. Molecular modeling of all 37 variants demonstrated clear 
disruptions in interactions with DNA, other histones, and histone chaperone 
proteins. Patient histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) analysis 
revealed notably aberrant local PTM patterns distinct from the somatic lysine 
mutations that cause global PTM dysregulation. RNA sequencing on patient cells 
demonstrated up-regulated gene expression related to mitosis and cell division, 
and cellular assays confirmed an increased proliferative capacity. A zebrafish 
model showed craniofacial anomalies and a defect in Foxd3-derived glia. These 
data suggest that the mechanism of germline mutations are distinct from 
cancer-associated somatic histone mutations but may converge on control of cell 
proliferation.

Mobile health (m-Health) resources are emerging as a significant tool to 
overcome mental health support access barriers due to their ability to rapidly 
reach and provide support to individuals in need of mental health support. 
m-Health provides an approach to adapt and initiate mental health support at 
precise moments, when they are most likely to be effective for the individual. 
However, poor adoption of mental health apps in the real world suggests that new 
approaches to optimising the quality of m-Health interventions are critically 
needed in order to realise the potential translational benefits for mental 
health support. The micro-randomised trial is an experimental approach for 
optimising and adapting m-Health resources. This trial design provides data to 
construct and optimise m-Health interventions. The data can be used to inform 
when and what type of m-Health interventions should be initiated, and thus serve 
to integrate interventions into daily routines with precision. Here, we 
illustrate this approach in a case study, review implementation issues that need 
to be considered while conducting an MRT, and provide a checklist for mental 
health m-Health intervention developers.

Comment in
    Am J Psychiatry. 2018 Jan 1;175(1):1.

The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) is the largest consortium in the 
history of psychiatry. This global effort is dedicated to rapid progress and 
open science, and in the past decade it has delivered an increasing flow of new 
knowledge about the fundamental basis of common psychiatric disorders. The PGC 
has recently commenced a program of research designed to deliver "actionable" 
findings-genomic results that 1) reveal fundamental biology, 2) inform clinical 
practice, and 3) deliver new therapeutic targets. The central idea of the PGC is 
to convert the family history risk factor into biologically, clinically, and 
therapeutically meaningful insights. The emerging findings suggest that we are 
entering a phase of accelerated genetic discovery for multiple psychiatric 
disorders. These findings are likely to elucidate the genetic portions of these 
truly complex traits, and this knowledge can then be mined for its relevance for 
improved therapeutics and its impact on psychiatric practice within a precision 
medicine framework. [AJP at 175: Remembering Our Past As We Envision Our Future

twin study of schizophrenia in 691 twin pairs was the largest in the field for 
nearly four decades. (Am J Psychiatry 1946; 103:309-322 )].

Climate change represents a major global challenge. Some hallmarks of climate 
change that have been connected to human activity include an increase of 
0.8-1.2 °C in global temperatures as well as the warming of upper ocean water. 
Importantly, approximately 500 million people worldwide face the consequences of 
desertification. Simultaneously, the world population has grown from 1.6 billion 
in 1900 to 7.7 billion today, greatly exacerbating the human toll of devastating 
environmental disasters, which result in increasingly larger and more common 
mass migrations that also fuel human trafficking and modern-day slavery. The 
mental health outcomes are staggering and include, in the context of chronic 
stress, addiction, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
bipolar disorder, major depression, and suicidality. Mental health 
practitioners, healthcare systems, and governments across the world need to be 
prepared to address the mental health sequelae of climate change.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly expanding into nearly all facets of life, 
particularly within the field of medicine. The diagnosis, characterization, 
management, and treatment of kidney cancer is ripe with areas for improvement 
that may be met with the promises of artificial intelligence. Here, we explore 
the impact of current research work in artificial intelligence for clinicians 
caring for patients with renal cancer, with a focus on the perspectives of 
radiologists, pathologists, and urologists. Promising preliminary results 
indicate that artificial intelligence may assist in the diagnosis and risk 
stratification of newly discovered renal masses and help guide the clinical 
treatment of patients with kidney cancer. However, much of the work in this 
field is still in its early stages, limited in its broader applicability, and 
hampered by small datasets, the varied appearance and presentation of kidney 
cancers, and the intrinsic limitations of the rigidly structured tasks 
artificial intelligence algorithms are trained to complete. Nonetheless, the 
continued exploration of artificial intelligence holds promise toward improving 
the clinical care of patients with kidney cancer.

Sepsis is one of the main causes of death in critically ill patients. Despite 
the continuous development of medical technology in recent years, its morbidity 
and mortality are still high. This is mainly related to the delay in starting 
treatment and non-adherence of clinical guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
is an evolving field in medicine, which has been used to develop a variety of 
innovative Clinical Decision Support Systems. It has shown great potential in 
predicting the clinical condition of patients and assisting in clinical 
decision-making. AI-derived algorithms can be applied to multiple stages of 
sepsis, such as early prediction, prognosis assessment, mortality prediction, 
and optimal management. This review describes the latest literature on AI for 
clinical decision support in sepsis, and outlines the application of AI in the 
prediction, diagnosis, subphenotyping, prognosis assessment, and clinical 
management of sepsis. In addition, we discussed the challenges of implementing 
and accepting this non-traditional methodology for clinical purposes.

Microglia are resident immune cells in the central nervous system, playing 
critical roles in brain development and homeostasis. Increasing evidence has 
implicated microglia dysfunction in the pathogenesis of various brain disorders 
ranging from psychiatric disorders to neurodegenerative diseases. Using a human 
cell-based model to illuminate the functional mechanisms of microglia will 
promote pathological studies and drug development. The recently developed 
microglia-containing human brain organoids (MC-HBOs), in-vitro three-dimensional 
cell cultures that recapitulate key features of the human brain, have provided a 
new avenue to model brain development and pathology. However, MC-HBOs generated 
from different methods differ in the origin, proportion, and fidelity of 
microglia within the organoids, and may have produced inconsistent results. To 
help researchers to develop a robust and reproducible model that recapitulates 
in-vivo signatures of human microglia to study brain development and pathology, 
this review summarized the current methods used to generate MC-HBOs and provided 
opinions on the use of MC-HBOs for disease modeling and functional studies.

Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion 
is standard of care. Evidence-based guidelines on eligibility for MT have been 
outlined and evidence to extend the treatment benefit to more patients, 
particularly those at the extreme ends of a stroke clinical severity spectrum, 
is currently awaited. As patient selection continues to be explored, there is 
growing focus on procedure selection including the tools and techniques of 
thrombectomy and associated outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been 
instrumental in the area of patient selection for MT with a role in diagnosis 
and delivery of acute stroke care. Machine learning algorithms have been 
developed to detect cerebral ischemia and early infarct core, presence of large 
vessel occlusion, and perfusion deficit in acute ischemic stroke. Several 
available deep learning AI applications provide ready visualization and 
interpretation of cervical and cerebral arteries. Further enhancement of AI 
techniques to potentially include automated vessel probe tools in suspected 
large vessel occlusions is proposed. Value of AI may be extended to assist in 
procedure selection including both the tools and technique of thrombectomy. 
Delivering personalized medicine is the wave of the future and tailoring the MT 
treatment to a stroke patient is in line with this trend.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus which became pandemic in the 
early 1980s. Since its initial characterization, advancements in diagnosis and 
management have transformed HIV infection from a terminal diagnosis to a 
chronic, manageable condition. Effective antiretroviral therapy, acting at 
multiple steps in the viral lifecycle, durably suppresses viral replication, 
preserves maternal health and prevents mother to child HIV transmission. Here, 
we review the salient clinical and ethical considerations of managing HIV 
infection during pregnancy and delivery.

Urothelial carcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma, is the most common 
urologic malignancy that carries significant morbidity, mortality, recurrence 
risk and associated health care costs. Despite use of current chemotherapies and 
immunotherapies, long-term remission in patients with muscle-invasive or 
metastatic disease remains low, and disease recurrence is common. The molecular 
chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90) may offer an ideal treatment target, as 
it is a critical signaling hub in urothelial carcinoma pathogenesis and 
potentiates chemoradiation. Preclinical testing with Hsp90 inhibitors has 
demonstrated reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis and synergism with 
chemotherapies and radiation. Despite promising preclinical data, clinical 
trials utilizing Hsp90 inhibitors for other malignancies had modest efficacy. 
Therefore, we propose that Hsp90 inhibition would best serve as an adjuvant 
treatment in advanced muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancers to 
potentiate other therapies. An overview of bladder cancer biology, current 
treatments, molecular targeted therapies, and the role for Hsp90 inhibitors in 
the treatment of urothelial carcinoma is the focus of this review.

In recent years, large-scale genomic studies have expanded our knowledge 
regarding genomic drivers in tumors of the central nervous system. While 
histopathologic analysis of brain tumors remains the primary method for tumor 
classification, the clinical utility of molecular and genomic testing to support 
and/or complement tumor classification continues to expand. This approach 
enhances diagnostic accuracy and provides clinicians with objective data to 
facilitate discussions regarding prognosis and treatment decisions, including 
selection of clinical trials. Ensuring accurate diagnoses is fundamental to the 
management of brain tumor patients. However, given the morphologic overlap among 
primary brain tumors, genomic data can be used to help distinguish tumor 
lineage. In its clearest form, we have embraced the concept of an integrated 
diagnosis, which combines traditional histopathology findings with molecular and 
genomic data. Patient prognosis varies significantly based on a tumor's genomic 
profile. For neuro-oncology patients, outcome studies linking diagnoses with 
genomic profiles show significant differences based on tumor biomarkers such as 
IDH1/2, H3F3A, BRAF, and CDKN2A and TERT status. Therefore, easy access to 
reliable genomic data is important in understanding a patient's disease and 
developing a clinical strategy wherein targeted molecular or immune therapies 
can be incorporated into the discussion.

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a widely used resource that 
comprehensively organizes and defines the phenotypic features of human disease, 
enabling computational inference and supporting genomic and phenotypic analyses 
through semantic similarity and machine learning algorithms. The HPO has 
widespread applications in clinical diagnostics and translational research, 
including genomic diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, and cohort analytics. In 
recent years, groups around the world have developed translations of the HPO 
from English to other languages, and the HPO browser has been internationalized, 
allowing users to view HPO term labels and in many cases synonyms and 
definitions in ten languages in addition to English. Since our last report, a 
total of 2239 new HPO terms and 49235 new HPO annotations were developed, many 
in collaboration with external groups in the fields of psychiatry, 
arthrogryposis, immunology and cardiology. The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) is 
a new effort to model treatments and other measures taken for clinical 
management. Finally, the HPO consortium is contributing to efforts to integrate 
the HPO and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema into electronic health records (EHRs) 
with the goal of more standardized and computable integration of rare disease 
data in EHRs.

The first licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia®), has received regulatory 
approval in a number of countries. However, this vaccine has some limitations. 
Its efficacy against DENV2 was consistently lower than other serotypes. 
Protective efficacy also depended on prior dengue sero-status of the vaccinees. 
Lower efficacy was observed in children with < 9 years old and dengue-na?ve 
individuals. More importantly, risk of hospitalization and severe dengue was 
increased in the youngest vaccine recipients (2-5 years) compared to controls. 
Thus, the quest of a better vaccine candidate continues. There are two 
live-attenuated vaccine candidates currently testing in phase III trial 
including DENVax, developed by US CDC and Inviragen (now licensed to Takeda) and 
TV003/TV005, constructed by US NIAID. In addition, there are several phase I-II 
as well as preclinical phase studies evaluating vaccines for safety and 
immunogenicity, this include other live-attenuated platform/strategy, 
purified-inactivated viruses formulated with adjuvants, DNA vaccine, subunit 
vaccine, viral vector and also heterologous prime/boost strategies. The major 
difficulties of dengue vaccine development are included the lack of the best 
animal model, various immune status of individual especially in endemic areas 
and clear cut off of protective immunity. Several research and development 
efforts are ongoing to find a better effective and accessible dengue vaccine for 
people needed.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obeticholic acid (OCA) has recently been restricted in 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with "advanced cirrhosis" 
because of its narrow therapeutic index. We aimed to better define the 
predicting factors of hepatic serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-response in 
cirrhotic patients undergoing OCA therapy.
METHODS: Safety and efficacy of treatment were evaluated in a cohort of 
consecutive PBC cirrhotic patients started with OCA. OCA response was evaluated 
according to the Poise criteria. Risk factors for hepatic SAEs and non-response 
were reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: One hundred PBC cirrhotics were included, 97 Child-Pugh class A and 3 
class B. Thirty-one had oesophageal varices and 5 had a history of ascites. 
Thirty-three per cent and 32% of patients achieved a biochemical response at 6 
and 12 months respectively. Male sex (adjusted-RR 1.75, 95%CI 1.42-2.12), INR 
(1.37, 1.00-1.87), Child-Pugh score (1.79, 1.28-2.50), MELD (1.17, 1.04-1.30) 
and bilirubin (1.83, 1.11-3.01) were independently associated with non-response 
to OCA. Twenty-two patients discontinued OCA within 12 months: 10 for pruritus, 
9 for hepatic SAEs (5 for jaundice and/or ascitic decompensation; 4 for upper 
digestive bleeding). INR (adjusted-RR 1.91, 95%CI 1.10-3.36), lower albumin 
levels (0.18, 0.06-0.51), Child-Pugh score (2.43, 1.50-4.04), history of ascites 
(3.5, 1.85-6.5) and bilirubin (1.30, 1.05-1.56), were associated with hepatic 
SAEs. A total bilirubin≥1.4 mg/dl at baseline was the most accurate biochemical 
predictor of hepatic SAEs under OCA.
CONCLUSIONS: An accurate baseline assessment is crucial to select cirrhotic 
patients who can benefit from OCA. Although OCA is effective in one third of 
cirrhotics, bilirubin level ≥1.4 mg/dl should discourage from its use.

Early response to viloxazine extended-release (viloxazine ER, Qelbree®) 
treatment predicted efficacy outcome in pediatric subjects with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study sought to determine 
whether the machine learning lasso model used in the pediatric study would 
predict response to viloxazine ER in an adult population based on early 
improvements in ADHD symptoms. We used data from a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, flexible-dose (200-600 mg) study of viloxazine ER (N = 354; 
18 to 60 years old). Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC 
AUC) statistics were computed using the lasso model from pediatric data to 
predict responder status in adults. Response was defined as ≥50% reduction from 
baseline in the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptoms Rating Scale (AISRS) Total 
score at Week 6. The adult study sample included 127 viloxazine ER-treated 
subjects with Week 6 data. Fifty-one subjects (40.2%) were categorized as 
responders. The ROC curves indicated that data collected up to Week 2 were 
sufficient to accurately predict treatment response at Week 6 with 68% positive 
predictive power, 80% sensitivity, and 74% specificity. This analysis 
demonstrated that the predictive model estimated from the child data generalizes 
to adults with ADHD, further supporting the consistency of viloxazine ER 
treatment across age groups.

Machine learning may assist in medical student evaluation. This study involved 
scoring short answer questions administered at three centres. Bidirectional 
encoder representations from transformers were particularly effective for 
professionalism question scoring (accuracy ranging from 41.6% to 92.5%). In the 
scoring of 3-mark professionalism questions, as compared with clinical 
questions, machine learning had a lower classification accuracy (P < 0.05). The 
role of machine learning in medical professionalism evaluation warrants further 
investigation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into clinical studies in the era 
of big data. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury 
(ALI) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses a heterogeneous population. 
Management of such heterogeneous patient population is a big challenge for 
clinicians. With accumulating ALI datasets being publicly available, more 
knowledge could be discovered with sophisticated analytics. We reviewed 
literatures with big data analytics to understand the role of AI for improving 
the caring of patients with ALI/ARDS. Many studies have utilized the electronic 
medical records (EMR) data for the identification and prognostication of ARDS 
patients. As increasing number of ARDS clinical trials data is open to public, 
secondary analysis on these combined datasets provide a powerful way of finding 
solution to clinical questions with a new perspective. AI techniques such as 
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and artificial neural networks (ANN) 
have also been successfully used in the investigation of ARDS problems. 
Individualized treatment of ARDS could be implemented with a support from AI as 
we are now able to classify ARDS into many subphenotypes by unsupervised machine 
learning algorithms. Interestingly, these subphenotypes show different responses 
to a certain intervention. However, current analytics involving ARDS have not 
fully incorporated information from omics such as transcriptome, proteomics, 
daily activities and environmental conditions. AI technology is assisting us to 
interpret complex data of ARDS patients and enable us to further improve the 
management of ARDS patients in future with individual treatment plans.

Rationale: In addition to rare genetic variants and the MUC5B locus, common 
genetic variants contribute to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) risk. The 
predictive power of common variants outside the MUC5B locus for IPF and 
interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) is unknown. Objectives: We tested the 
predictive value of IPF polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with and without the MUC5B 
region on IPF, ILA, and ILA progression. Methods: We developed PRSs that 
included (PRS-M5B) and excluded (PRS-NO-M5B) the MUC5B region (500-kb window 
around rs35705950-T) using an IPF genome-wide association study. We assessed PRS 
associations with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
metrics for IPF, ILA, and ILA progression. Measurements and Main Results: We 
included 14,650 participants (1,970 IPF; 1,068 ILA) from six multi-ancestry 
population-based and case-control cohorts. In cases excluded from genome-wide 
association study, the PRS-M5B (odds ratio [OR] per SD of the score, 3.1; 
P = 7.1 × 10-95) and PRS-NO-M5B (OR per SD, 2.8; P = 2.5 × 10-87) were 
associated with IPF. Participants in the top PRS-NO-M5B quintile had ∼sevenfold 
odds for IPF compared with those in the first quintile. A clinical model 
predicted IPF (AUC, 0.61); rs35705950-T and PRS-NO-M5B demonstrated higher AUCs 
(0.73 and 0.7, respectively), and adding both genetic predictors to a clinical 
model yielded the highest performance (AUC, 0.81). The PRS-NO-M5B was associated 
with ILA (OR, 1.25) and ILA progression (OR, 1.16) in European ancestry 
participants. Conclusions: A common genetic variant risk score complements the 
MUC5B variant to identify individuals at high risk of interstitial lung 
abnormalities and pulmonary fibrosis.

Examining community views on genetic/epigenetic research allows collaborative 
technology development. Parent perspectives toward genetic/epigenetic testing 
for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not well-studied. Parents of children 
with ASD (n = 131), non-ASD developmental delay (n = 39), and typical 
development (n = 74) completed surveys assessing genetic/epigenetic knowledge, 
genetic/epigenetic concerns, motives for research participation, and 
attitudes/preferences toward ASD testing. Most parents (96%) were interested in 
saliva-based molecular testing for ASD. Some had concerns about privacy (14%) 
and insurance-status (10%). None (0%) doubted scientific evidence behind 
genetic/epigenetic testing. Most reported familiarity with genetics (88%), but 
few understood differences from epigenetics (19%). Child developmental status 
impacted insurance concerns (p = 0.01). There is broad parent interest in a 
genetic/epigenetic test for ASD. It will be crucial to carefully consider and 
address bioethical issues surrounding this sensitive topic while developing such 
technology.

Pre-mRNA splicing is a highly coordinated process. While its dysregulation has 
been linked to neurological deficits, our understanding of the underlying 
molecular and cellular mechanisms remains limited. We implicated pathogenic 
variants in U2AF2 and PRPF19, encoding spliceosome subunits in 
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), by identifying 46 unrelated individuals 
with 23 de novo U2AF2 missense variants (including 7 recurrent variants in 30 
individuals) and 6 individuals with de novo PRPF19 variants. Eight U2AF2 
variants dysregulated splicing of a model substrate. Neuritogenesis was reduced 
in human neurons differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells carrying two 
U2AF2 hyper-recurrent variants. Neural loss of function (LoF) of the Drosophila 
orthologs U2af50 and Prp19 led to lethality, abnormal mushroom body (MB) 
patterning, and social deficits, which were differentially rescued by wild-type 
and mutant U2AF2 or PRPF19. Transcriptome profiling revealed splicing substrates 
or effectors (including Rbfox1, a third splicing factor), which rescued MB 
defects in U2af50-deficient flies. Upon reanalysis of negative clinical exomes 
followed by data sharing, we further identified 6 patients with NDD who carried 
RBFOX1 missense variants which, by in vitro testing, showed LoF. Our study 
implicates 3 splicing factors as NDD-causative genes and establishes a genetic 
network with hierarchy underlying human brain development and function.

To utilise effectively tools that employ machine learning (ML) in clinical 
practice medical students and doctors will require a degree of understanding of 
ML models. To evaluate current levels of understanding, a formative examination 
and survey was conducted across three centres in Australia, New Zealand and the 
United States. Of the 245 individuals who participated in the study (response 
rate = 45.4%), the majority had difficulty with identifying weaknesses in model 
performance analysis. Further studies examining educational interventions 
addressing such ML topics are warranted.

Since its inaugural issue in 2019, Radiology: Cardiothoracic Imaging has 
disseminated the latest scientific advances and technical developments in 
cardiac, vascular, and thoracic imaging. In this review, we highlight select 
articles published in this journal between October 2021 and October 2022. The 
scope of the review encompasses various aspects of coronary artery and 
congenital heart diseases, vascular diseases, thoracic imaging, and health 
services research. Key highlights include changes in the revised Coronary Artery 
Disease Reporting and Data System 2.0, the value of coronary CT angiography in 
informing prognosis and guiding treatment decisions, cardiac MRI findings after

Natural vibrations and resonances are intrinsic features of protein structures 
and enable differentiation of one structure from another. These nanoscale 
features are important to help to understand the dynamics of a protein molecule 
and identify the effects of small sequence or other geometric alterations that 
may not cause significant visible structural changes, such as point mutations 
associated with disease or drug design. Although normal mode analysis provides a 
powerful way to accurately extract the natural frequencies of a protein, it must 
meet several critical conditions, including availability of high-resolution 
structures, availability of good chemical force fields and memory-intensive 
large-scale computing resources. Here, we study the natural frequency of over 
100 000 known protein molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and use 
this dataset to carefully investigate the correlation between their structural 
features and these natural frequencies by using a machine learning model 
composed of a Feedforward Neural Network made of four hidden layers that 
predicts the natural frequencies in excellent agreement with full-atomistic 
normal mode calculations, but is significantly more computationally efficient. 
In addition to the computational advance, we demonstrate that this model can be 
used to directly obtain the natural frequencies by merely using five structural 
features of protein molecules as predictor variables, including the largest and 
smallest diameter, and the ratio of amino acid residues with alpha-helix, beta 
strand and 3-10 helix domains. These structural features can be either 
experimentally or computationally obtained, and do not require a full-atomistic 
model of a protein of interest. This method is helpful in predicting the 
absorption and resonance functions of an unknown protein molecule without 
solving its full atomic structure.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Prostate MRI improves detection of clinically 
significant prostate cancer; however, its diagnostic performance has wide 
variation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to assist radiologists 
in the detection and classification of prostatic lesions. Herein, we aimed to 
develop and test a cascaded deep learning detection and classification system 
trained on biparametric prostate MRI using PI-RADS for assisting radiologists 
during prostate MRI read out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (ADC maps, high b value 
DWI) MRI scans obtained at 3 Tesla from two institutions (n = 1043 in-house and 
n = 347 Prostate-X, respectively) acquired between 2015 to 2019 were used for 
model training, validation, testing. All scans were retrospectively reevaluated 
by one radiologist. Suspicious lesions were contoured and assigned a PI-RADS 
category. A 3D U-Net-based deep neural network was used to train an algorithm 
for automated detection and segmentation of prostate MRI lesions. Two 3D 
residual neural network were used for a 4-class classification task to predict 
PI-RADS categories 2 to 5 and BPH. Training and validation used 89% (n = 1290 
scans) of the data using 5 fold cross-validation, the remaining 11% (n = 150 
scans) were used for independent testing. Algorithm performance at lesion level 
was assessed using sensitivities, positive predictive values (PPV), false 
discovery rates (FDR), classification accuracy, Dice similarity coefficient 
(DSC). Additional analysis was conducted to compare AI algorithm's lesion 
detection performance with targeted biopsy results.
RESULTS: Median age was 66 years (IQR = 60-71), PSA 6.7 ng/ml (IQR = 4.7-9.9) 
from in-house cohort. In the independent test set, algorithm correctly detected 
111 of 198 lesions leading to 56.1% (49.3%-62.6%) sensitivity. PPV was 62.7% 
(95% CI 54.7%-70.7%) with FDR of 37.3% (95% CI 29.3%-45.3%). Of 79 true positive 
lesions, 82.3% were tumor positive at targeted biopsy, whereas of 57 false 
negative lesions, 50.9% were benign at targeted biopsy. Median DSC for lesion 
segmentation was 0.359. Overall PI-RADS classification accuracy was 30.8% (95% 
CI 24.6%-37.8%).
CONCLUSION: Our cascaded U-Net, residual network architecture can detect, 
classify cancer suspicious lesions at prostate MRI with good detection, 
reasonable classification performance metrics.

INTRODUCTION: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs in individuals with 
deleterious genetic mutations on both chromosomes (maternal and paternal) in 
SERPINA1, the gene encoding the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein. There has been 
substantial progress in understanding the genetic variation that underlies the 
heterogeneous penetrance of lung disease in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
AREAS COVERED: This review will cover SERPINA1 gene structure and genetic 
variation, population genetics, genome-wide genetic modifiers of lung disease, 
alternative mechanisms of disease, and emerging therapeutics - including gene 
and cell therapy - related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung 
disease.
EXPERT OPINION: There remains ample opportunity to employ precision medicine in 
the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of alpha-1 antitrypsin 
deficiency-associated lung disease. In particular, a genome-wide association 
study and subsequent polygenic risk score is an important first step in 
identifying genome-wide genetic modifiers contributing to the variability of 
lung disease in severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major healthcare and socio-economic challenge. 
Despite its substantial burden on society, the research activity in BD is much 
smaller than its economic impact appears to demand. There is a consensus that 
the accurate identification of the underlying pathophysiology for BD is 
fundamental to realize major health benefits through better treatment and 
preventive regimens. However, to achieve these goals requires coordinated action 
and innovative approaches to boost the discovery of the neurobiological 
underpinnings of BD, and rapid translation of research findings into development 
and testing of better and more specific treatments. To this end, we here propose 
that only a large-scale coordinated action can be successful in integrating 
international big-data approaches with real-world clinical interventions. This 
could be achieved through the creation of a Global Bipolar Disorder Foundation, 
which could bring government, industry and philanthropy together in common 
cause. A global initiative for BD research would come at a highly opportune time 
given the seminal advances promised for our understanding of the genetic and 
brain basis of the disease and the obvious areas of unmet clinical need. Such an 
endeavour would embrace the principles of open science and see the strong 
involvement of user groups and integration of dissemination and public 
involvement with the research programs. We believe the time is right for a step 
change in our approach to understanding, treating and even preventing BD 
effectively.

Machine learning methods, combined with large electronic health databases, could 
enable a personalised approach to medicine through improved diagnosis and 
prediction of individual responses to therapies. If successful, this strategy 
would represent a revolution in clinical research and practice. However, 
although the vision of individually tailored medicine is alluring, there is a 
need to distinguish genuine potential from hype. We argue that the goal of 
personalised medical care faces serious challenges, many of which cannot be 
addressed through algorithmic complexity, and call for collaboration between 
traditional methodologists and experts in medical machine learning to avoid 
extensive research waste.

OBJECTIVE: Machine learning (ML) has been applied to develop magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)-based diagnostic classifiers for attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). This systematic review examines this literature to clarify its 
clinical significance and to assess the implications of the various analytic 
methods applied.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search on MRI-based diagnostic classifiers 
for ADHD was performed and data regarding the utilized models and samples were 
gathered.
RESULTS: We found that, although most studies reported the classification 
accuracies, they varied in choice of MRI modalities, ML models, cross-validation 
and testing methods, and sample sizes. We found that the accuracies of 
cross-validation methods inflated the performance estimation compared with those 
of a held-out test, compromising the model generalizability. Test accuracies 
have increased with publication year but were not associated with training 
sample sizes. Improved test accuracy over time was likely due to the use of 
better ML methods along with strategies to deal with data imbalances.
CONCLUSION: Ultimately, large multi-modal imaging datasets, and potentially the 
combination with other types of data, like cognitive data and/or genetics, will 
be essential to achieve the goal of developing clinically useful imaging 
classification tools for ADHD in the future.

University, Syracuse, New York 13210.

Formins are a family of regulators of actin and microtubule dynamics that are 
present in almost all eukaryotes. These proteins are involved in many cellular 
processes, including cytokinesis, stress fiber formation, and cell polarization. 
Here we review one subfamily of formins, the inverted formins. Inverted formins 
as a group break several formin stereotypes, having atypical biochemical 
properties and domain organization, and they have been linked to kidney disease 
and neuropathy in humans. In this review, we will explore recent research on 
members of the inverted formin sub-family in mammals, zebrafish, fruit flies, 
and worms.

Oral solid dosage forms, specifically immediate release tablets, are prevalent 
in the pharmaceutical industry. Disintegration testing is often the first step 
of commercialization and large-scale production of these dosage forms. Current 
disintegration testing in the pharmaceutical industry, according to United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapter 〈701〉, only gives information about the 
duration of the tablet disintegration process. This information is subjective, 
variable, and prone to human error due to manual or physical data collection 
methods via the human eye or contact disks. To lessen the data integrity risk 
associated with this process, efforts have been made to automate the analysis of 
the disintegration process using digital lens and other imaging technologies. 
This would provide a non-invasive method to quantitatively determine 
disintegration time through computer algorithms. The main challenges associated 
with developing such a system involve visualization of tablet pieces through 
cloudy and turbid liquid. The Computer Vision for Disintegration (CVD) system 
has been developed to be used along with traditional pharmaceutical 
disintegration testing devices to monitor tablet pieces and distinguish them 
from the surrounding liquid. The software written for CVD utilizes data captured 
by cameras or other lenses then uses mobile SSD and CNN, with an OpenCV and 
FRCNN machine learning model, to analyze and interpret the data. This technology 
is capable of consistently identifying tablets with ≥ 99.6% accuracy. Not only 
is the data produced by CVD more reliable, but it opens the possibility of a 
deeper understanding of disintegration rates and mechanisms in addition to 
duration.

Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder (BD). There is, 
however, high variability in treatment response to lithium and only 20-30% of 
individuals with BD are excellent responders. This subgroup has been shown to 
have specific phenotypic characteristics, and family studies have implicated 
genetics as an important factor. However, candidate gene studies did not find 
evidence for major effect genes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have 
emphasized that lithium response is a polygenic trait. GWAS based on larger 
sample sizes and non-European ancestries are likely to shed light on the genomic 
architecture of this trait. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells, 
transcriptomics, epigenetics, the integration of multiple omics data, and their 
combination with advanced machine learning techniques hold promise for the 
understanding of the complex biological underpinnings of lithium treatment 
response.

With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced laser 
interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field 
of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe. The 
extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through 
exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from 
non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a 
variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the 
data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are 
transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so 
that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. 
Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new 
morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic 
true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is 
paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that 
are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for 
members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of 
data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines 
crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of 
categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the 
Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to 
categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into 
pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as 
the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to 
categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the 
morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, 
we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and 
accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and 
characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and 
subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby 
improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We 
demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first 
observing run.

Role of Rucaparib in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer: Clinical Perspectives and 
Considerations.

Wu MS(1), Goldberg H(1).

Author information:

Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and has 
strong genetic associations. This is important for the development of 
therapeutics for the condition, as metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC) is resistant to standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and has a 
relatively poor prognosis. We conducted a literature review on rucaparib, a 
poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that is currently 
indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRPC who harbor mutations in 
BRCA1/2 (homologous recombination repair [HRR] genes) and who have already tried 
androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapies (ARAT) and a taxane chemotherapy. We 
describe rucaparib's FDA approval, which was based on the results of the 
single-arm, open-label, Phase II TRITON2 clinical trial, which found an 
objective response rate (ORR) of 43.5%, a duration of response (DOR) of over six 
months in length and an acceptable safety profile. Rucaparib's dosage and 
clinical considerations for use were also discussed. We also compared 
rucaparib's use and safety profile with Olaparib, niraparib and talazoparib, 
three other PARP inhibitors tested for the treatment of mCRPC. Overall, initial 
results show that the safety profile of all four drugs in mCRPC was relatively 
similar, and further testing is currently indicated for all four. Differences in 
their metabolism, however, also warrant further research. The clinical validity 
of rucaparib will be tested by the follow-up TRITON3 clinical trial, which is 
comparing the effect of rucaparib compared to standard therapies for mCRPC 
harboring BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations. Other than TRITON3, other clinical trials 
are testing rucaparib's ability against other cancers (prostate or otherwise) 
with HRR mutations, and also the efficacy of combination therapies involving 
rucaparib. Finally, more research is needed to elucidate rucaparib's effect on 
HRR mutations other than BRCA1/2. Advancements in understanding the genetic 
landscape of mCRPC will also assist in understanding rucaparib's full 
therapeutic potential.

Current conventional endoscopes have restricted the accuracy of treatment 
delivery and monitoring. Over the past decade, there have been major 
developments in nanotechnology and light triggered therapy, potentially allowing 
a better detection of challenging lesions and targeted treatment of malignancies 
in the gastrointestinal tract. Theranostics is a developing form of personalized 
medicine because it combines diagnosis and targeted treatment delivered in one 
step using advances in nanotechnology. This review describes the light-triggered 
therapies (including photodynamic, photothermal, and photoimmunotherapies), 
nanotechnological advances with nanopowder, nanostent, nanogels, and 
nanoparticles, enhancements brought to endoscopic ultrasound, in addition to 
experimental endoscopic techniques, combining both enhanced diagnoses and 
therapies, including a developed prototype of a "smart" multifunctional 
endoscope for localized colorectal cancer, near-infrared laser endoscope 
targeting the gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the concept of endocapsule for 
obscure gastrointestinal bleed, and a proof-of-concept therapeutic capsule using 
ultrasound-mediated targeted drug delivery. Hence, the following term has been 
proposed encompassing these technologies: "Theranostic gastrointestinal 
endoscopy." Future efforts for integration of these technologies into clinical 
practice would be directed toward translational and clinical trials translating 
into a more personalized and interdisciplinary diagnosis and treatment, shorter 
procedural time, higher precision, higher cost-effectiveness, and less need for 
repetitive procedures.

Neuropsychiatric disorders are difficult to diagnose because of phenotypic 
heterogeneity within and symptomatic overlap between disorders. This review 
describes how genomics and blood-based gene expression have shown potential as 
biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and 
major depressive disorder) yet also discusses how a complex genetic landscape 
has limited sole genetic diagnostic tools for these disorders. In addition to 
their potential use as classifiers for neuropsychiatric disorders, genomic and 
blood-based biomarkers have revealed clues to the molecular pathways 
contributing to etiology. A comprehensive overview of studies to date has been 
given, and the authors provide suggestions for steps to be taken to ultimately 
move the laboratory-based classifiers towards application in a clinical setting. 
Furthermore, they share their vision for the future of these classifiers, both 
in clinical application and in opening up new ways to gain insights into the 
underlying biology.

Sepsis: The evolution in definition, pathophysiology, and management.

Gyawali B(1), Ramakrishna K(1), Dhamoon AS(1).

There has been a significant evolution in the definition and management of 
sepsis over the last three decades. This is driven in part due to the advances 
made in our understanding of its pathophysiology. There is evidence to show that 
the manifestations of sepsis can no longer be attributed only to the infectious 
agent and the immune response it engenders, but also to significant alterations 
in coagulation, immunosuppression, and organ dysfunction. A revolutionary change 
in the way we manage sepsis has been the adoption of early goal-directed 
therapy. This involves the early identification of at-risk patients and prompt 
treatment with antibiotics, hemodynamic optimization, and appropriate supportive 
care. This has contributed significantly to the overall improved outcomes with 
sepsis. Investigation into clinically relevant biomarkers of sepsis are ongoing 
and have yet to yield effective results. Scoring systems such as the sequential 
organ failure assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation help 
risk-stratify patients with sepsis. Advances in precision medicine techniques 
and the development of targeted therapy directed at limiting the excesses of the 
inflammatory and coagulatory cascades offer potentially viable avenues for 
future research. This review summarizes the progress made in the diagnosis and 
management of sepsis over the past two decades and examines promising avenues 
for future research.

The debate over human visual perception and how medical images should be 
interpreted have persisted since X-rays were the only imaging technique 
available. Concerns over rates of disagreement between expert image readers are 
associated with much of the clinical research and at times driven by the belief 
that any image endpoint variability is problematic. The deeper understanding of 
the reasons, value, and risk of disagreement are somewhat siloed, leading, at 
times, to costly and risky approaches, especially in clinical trials. Although 
artificial intelligence promises some relief from mistakes, its routine 
application for assessing tumors within cancer trials is still an aspiration. 
Our consortium of international experts in medical imaging for drug development 
research, the Pharma Imaging Network for Therapeutics and Diagnostics (PINTAD), 
tapped the collective knowledge of its members to ground expectations, summarize 
common reasons for reader discordance, identify what factors can be controlled 
and which actions are likely to be effective in reducing discordance. Reinforced 
by an exhaustive literature review, our work defines the forces that shape 
reader variability. This review article aims to produce a singular authoritative 
resource outlining reader performance's practical realities within cancer 
trials, whether they occur within a clinical or an independent central review.

IMPORTANCE: A true revolution in the management of advanced genitourinary 
cancers has occurred with the discovery and adoption of immunotherapy (IO). The 
therapeutic benefits of IO were recently observed not to be solely confined to 
patients with disseminated disease but also in select patients with localized 
and locally advanced genitourinary neoplasms.
OBSERVATIONS: KEYNOTE-057 demonstrated the benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy 
for treating high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer unresponsive to 
bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), resulting in recent US Food and Drug 
Administration approval. Furthermore, a current phase 3 trial (Checkmate274) 
demonstrated a disease-free survival benefit with the administration of adjuvant 
nivolumab vs placebo in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma after radical 
cystectomy. In addition, the recent highly publicized phase 3 KEYNOTE 564 trial 
demonstrated a recurrence-free survival benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab in 
patients with high-risk localized/locally advanced kidney cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The adoption and integration of IO in the management 
of localized genitourinary cancers exhibiting aggressive phenotypes are becoming 
an emerging therapeutic paradigm. Clinical oncologists and scientists should 
become familiar with these trials and indications because they are likely to 
dramatically change our treatment strategies in the months and years to come.

The development of programmable nucleases to introduce defined alterations in 
genomic sequences has been a powerful tool for precision medicine. While several 
nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor activator-like 
effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored, the advent of 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering. In 
addition to disease modeling, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has contributed to 
safer and more effective treatment strategies for hematologic diseases and 
personalized T-cell-based therapies. Here we discuss the applications of the 
CRISPR technology in the treatment of hematologic diseases, their efficacy, and 
ongoing clinical trials. We examine the obstacles to their successful use and 
the approaches investigated to overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide 
our perspectives to improve this genome editing tool for targeted therapies.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common 
neurodevelopmental disorders, and around two-thirds of affected children report 
persisting problems in adulthood. This negative trajectory is associated with 
high comorbidity with disorders like obesity, depression, or substance use 
disorder (SUD). Decreases in cortical volume and thickness have also been 
reported in depression, SUD, and obesity, but it is unclear whether structural 
brain alterations represent unique disorder-specific profiles. A transdiagnostic 
exploration of ADHD and typical comorbid disorders could help to understand 
whether specific morphometric brain changes are due to ADHD or, alternatively, 
to the comorbid disorders. In the current study, we studied the brain 
morphometry of 136 subjects with ADHD with and without comorbid depression, SUD, 
and obesity to test whether there are unique or common brain alterations. We 
employed a machine-learning-algorithm trained to classify subjects with ADHD in 
the large ENIGMA-ADHD dataset and used it to predict the diagnostic status of 
subjects with ADHD and/or comorbidities. The parcellation analysis demonstrated 
decreased cortical thickness in medial prefrontal areas that was associated with 
presence of any comorbidity. However, these results did not survive correction 
for multiple comparisons. Similarly, the machine learning analysis indicated 
that the predictive algorithm grouped most of our ADHD participants as belonging 
to the ADHD-group, but no systematic differences between comorbidity status came 
up. In sum, neither a classical comparison of segmented structural brain metrics 
nor an ML model based on the ADHD ENIGMA data differentiate between ADHD with 
and without comorbidities. As the ML model is based in part on adolescent 
brains, this might indicate that comorbid disorders and their brain changes are 
not captured by the ML model because it represents a different developmental 
brain trajectory.

With the dramatic growth of data in both amount and scale, distributed machine 
learning has become an important tool for the massive data to finish the tasks 
as prediction, classification, etc. However, due to the practical physical 
constraints and the potention privacy leakage of data, it is infeasible to 
aggregate raw data from all data owners for the learning purpose. To tackle this 
problem, the distributed privacy-preserving learning approaches are introduced 
to learn over all distributed data without exposing the real information. 
However, existing approaches have limits on the complicated distributed system. 
On the one hand, traditional privacy-preserving learning approaches rely on 
heavy cryptographic primitives on training data, in which the learning speed is 
dramatically slowed down due to the computation overheads. On the other hand, 
the complicated system architecture becomes a barrier in the practical 
distributed system. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving 
machine learning scheme for hierarchical distributed systems. We modify and 
improve the collaborative learning algorithm. The proposed scheme not only 
reduces the overhead for the learning process but also provides the 
comprehensive protection for each layer of the hierarchical distributed system. 
In addition, based on the analysis of the collaborative convergency in different 
learning groups, we also propose an asynchronous strategy to further improve the 
learning efficiency of hierarchical distributed system. At the last, extensive 
experiments on real-world data are implemented to evaluate the privacy, 
efficacy, and efficiency of our proposed schemes.

Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Wound Healing Response.

Urao N(1), Liu J(1), Takahashi K(1), Ganesh G(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pharmacology, State University of New York Upstate Medical 
University, Syracuse, New York, USA.

Significance: Emerging evidence has shown a link between the status of 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and wound healing responses. Thus, better 
understanding HSCs will contribute to further advances in wound healing 
research. Recent Advances: Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and 
monocyte-derived macrophages are critical players in the process of wound 
healing. HSCs actively respond to wound injury and other tissue insults, 
including infection and produce the effector myeloid cells, and a failing of the 
HSC response can result in impaired wound healing. Technological advances such 
as transcriptome at single-cell resolution, epigenetics, three-dimensional 
imaging, transgenic animals, and animal models, have provided novel concepts of 
myeloid generation (myelopoiesis) from HSCs, and have revealed cell-intrinsic 
and -extrinsic mechanisms that can impact HSC functions in the context of health 
conditions. Critical Issues: The newer concepts include-the programmed cellular 
fate at a differentiation stage that is used to be considered as the 
multilineage, the signaling pathways that can activate HSCs directly and 
indirectly, the mechanisms that can deteriorate HSCs, the roles and remodeling 
of the surrounding environment for HSCs and their progenitors (the niche). 
Future Directions: The researches on HSCs, which produce blood cells, should

wounds, which may transform clinical practice of wound care with precision

Metastatic breast, prostate, lung, and other cancers often affect bone, causing 
pain, increasing fracture risk, and decreasing function. Management of 
metastatic bone disease (MBD) is clinically challenging when there is potential 
but uncertain risk of pathological fracture. Management of MBD has become a 
major focus within orthopedic oncology with respect to fracture and impending 
fracture care. If impending skeletal-related events (SREs), particularly 
pathologic fracture, could be predicted, increasing evidence suggests that 
prophylactic surgical treatment improves patient outcomes. However, current 
fracture risk assessment and radiographic metrics do not have high accuracy and 
have not been combined with relevant patient survival tools. This review first 
explores the prevalence, incidence, and morbidity of MBD and associated SREs for 
different cancer types. Strengths and limitations of current fracture risk 
scoring systems for spinal stability and long bone fracture are highlighted. 
More recent computed tomography (CT)-based structural rigidity analysis (CTRA) 
and finite element (FE) analysis methods offer advantages of increased 
specificity (true negative rate), but are limited in availability. Other 
fracture prediction approaches including parametric response mapping and 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography measures show early promise. 
Substantial new information to inform clinical decision-making includes measures 
of survival, clinical benefits, and economic analysis of prophylactic treatment 
compared to after-fracture stabilization. Areas of future research include use 
of big data and machine learning to predict SREs, greater access and refinement 
of CTRA/FE approaches, combination of clinical survival prediction tools with 
radiographically based fracture risk assessment, and net benefit analysis for 
fracture risk assessment and prophylactic treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Immune system dysfunction is hypothesised to contribute to structural 
brain changes through aberrant synaptic pruning in schizophrenia. However, 
evidence is mixed and there is a lack of evidence of inflammation and its effect 
on grey matter volume (GMV) in patients. We hypothesised that inflammatory 
subgroups can be identified and that the subgroups will show distinct 
neuroanatomical and neurocognitive profiles.
METHODS: The total sample consisted of 1067 participants (chronic patients with 
schizophrenia n = 467 and healthy controls (HCs) n = 600) from the Australia 
Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB) dataset, together with 218 recent-onset 
patients with schizophrenia from the external Benefit of Minocycline on Negative 
Symptoms of Psychosis: Extent and Mechanism (BeneMin) dataset. HYDRA 
(HeterogeneitY through DiscRiminant Analysis) was used to separate schizophrenia 
from HC and define disease-related subgroups based on inflammatory markers. 
Voxel-based morphometry and inferential statistics were used to explore GMV 
alterations and neurocognitive deficits in these subgroups.
RESULTS: An optimal clustering solution revealed five main schizophrenia groups 
separable from HC: Low Inflammation, Elevated CRP, Elevated IL-6/IL-8, Elevated 
IFN-γ, and Elevated IL-10 with an adjusted Rand index of 0.573. When compared 
with the healthy controls, the IL-6/IL-8 cluster showed the most widespread, 
including the anterior cingulate, GMV reduction. The IFN-γ inflammation cluster 
showed the least GMV reduction and impairment of cognitive performance. The CRP 
and the Low Inflammation clusters dominated in the younger external dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation in schizophrenia may not be merely a case of low vs 
high, but rather there are pluripotent, heterogeneous mechanisms at play which 
could be reliably identified based on accessible, peripheral measures. This 
could inform the successful development of targeted interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate enabling multi-institutional training without 
centralizing or sharing the underlying physical data via federated learning 
(FL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Deep learning models were trained at each participating 
institution using local clinical data, and an additional model was trained using 
FL across all of the institutions.
RESULTS: We found that the FL model exhibited superior performance and 
generalizability to the models trained at single institutions, with an overall 
performance level that was significantly better than that of any of the 
institutional models alone when evaluated on held-out test sets from each 
institution and an outside challenge dataset.
DISCUSSION: The power of FL was successfully demonstrated across 3 academic 
institutions while avoiding the privacy risk associated with the transfer and 
pooling of patient data.
CONCLUSION: Federated learning is an effective methodology that merits further 
study to enable accelerated development of models across institutions, enabling 
greater generalizability in clinical use.

BACKGROUND: Nonophthalmologist physicians do not confidently perform direct 
ophthalmoscopy. The use of artificial intelligence to detect papilledema and 
other optic-disk abnormalities from fundus photographs has not been well 
studied.
METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning system to 
classify optic disks as being normal or having papilledema or other 
abnormalities from 15,846 retrospectively collected ocular fundus photographs 
that had been obtained with pharmacologic pupillary dilation and various digital 
cameras in persons from multiple ethnic populations. Of these photographs, 
14,341 from 19 sites in 11 countries were used for training and validation, and 
1505 photographs from 5 other sites were used for external testing. Performance 
at classifying the optic-disk appearance was evaluated by calculating the area 
under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and 
specificity, as compared with a reference standard of clinical diagnoses by 
neuro-ophthalmologists.
RESULTS: The training and validation data sets from 6779 patients included 
14,341 photographs: 9156 of normal disks, 2148 of disks with papilledema, and 
3037 of disks with other abnormalities. The percentage classified as being 
normal ranged across sites from 9.8 to 100%; the percentage classified as having 
papilledema ranged across sites from zero to 59.5%. In the validation set, the 
system discriminated disks with papilledema from normal disks and disks with 
nonpapilledema abnormalities with an AUC of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.98 to 0.99) and normal from abnormal disks with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99 
to 0.99). In the external-testing data set of 1505 photographs, the system had 
an AUC for the detection of papilledema of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97), a 
sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI, 93.9 to 98.3), and a specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 
82.3 to 87.1).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning system using fundus photographs with 
pharmacologically dilated pupils differentiated among optic disks with 
papilledema, normal disks, and disks with nonpapilledema abnormalities. (Funded

An increasing aging population poses a significant challenge to societies 
worldwide. A better understanding of the molecular, cellular, organ, tissue, 
physiological, psychological, and even sociological changes that occur with 
aging is needed in order to treat age-associated diseases. The field of aging 
research is rapidly expanding with multiple advances transpiring in many 
previously disconnected areas. Several major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and 
consumer companies made aging research a priority and are building internal 
expertise, integrating aging research into traditional business models and 
exploring new go-to-market strategies. Many of these efforts are spearheaded by 
the latest advances in artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, including 
generative and reinforcement learning. To facilitate these trends, the Center 
for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen and Insilico Medicine are 
building a community of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in these areas and launched 
the annual conference series titled "Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD)" 
held in the capital of the pharmaceutical industry, Basel, Switzerland 
(www.agingpharma.org). This ARDD collection contains summaries from the 6th 
annual meeting that explored aging mechanisms and new interventions in 
age-associated diseases. The 7th annual ARDD exhibition will transpire 2nd-4th 
of September, 2020, in Basel.

Viruses have brought humanity many challenges: respiratory infection, cancer, 
neurological impairment and immunosuppression to name a few. Virology research 
over the last 60+ years has responded to reduce this disease burden with 
vaccines and antivirals. Despite this long history, the COVID-19 pandemic has 
brought unprecedented attention to the field of virology. Some of this attention 
is focused on concern about the safe conduct of research with human pathogens. A 
small but vocal group of individuals has seized upon these concerns - conflating 
legitimate questions about safely conducting virus-related research with 
uncertainties over the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The result has fueled public 
confusion and, in many instances, ill-informed condemnation of virology. With 
this article, we seek to promote a return to rational discourse. We explain the 
use of gain-of-function approaches in science, discuss the possible origins of 
SARS-CoV-2 and outline current regulatory structures that provide oversight for 
virological research in the United States. By offering our expertise, we - a 
broad group of working virologists - seek to aid policy makers in navigating 
these controversial issues. Balanced, evidence-based discourse is essential to 
addressing public concern while maintaining and expanding much-needed research 
in virology.

Failure to obtain the recommended 7−9 h of sleep has been associated with 
injuries in youth and adults. However, most research on the influence of prior 
night’s sleep and gait has been conducted on older adults and clinical 
populations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify individuals 
who experience partial sleep deprivation and/or sleep extension the prior night 
using single task gait. Participants (n = 123, age 24.3 ± 4.0 years; 65% female) 
agreed to participate in this study. Self-reported sleep duration of the night 
prior to testing was collected. Gait data was collected with inertial sensors 
during a 2 min walk test. Group differences (<7 h and >9 h, poor sleepers; 7−9 
h, good sleepers) in gait characteristics were assessed using machine learning 
and a post-hoc ANCOVA. Results indicated a correlation (r = 0.79) between gait 
parameters and prior night’s sleep. The most accurate machine learning model was 
a Random Forest Classifier using the top 9 features, which had a mean accuracy 
of 65.03%. Our findings suggest that good sleepers had more asymmetrical gait 
patterns and were better at maintaining gait speed than poor sleepers. Further 
research with larger subject sizes is needed to develop more accurate machine 
learning models to identify prior night’s sleep using single-task gait.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aspires to summarize the landmark advancements in 
the management of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both historically and 
contemporarily with special focus in older adults.
RECENT FINDINGS: The past two decades have witnessed remarkable improvements in 
the diagnosis and management of lung cancer. Screening recommendations now 
facilitate earlier diagnosis in high-risk individuals, PET/CT scans have 
improved radiologic accuracy in identifying sites of disease, and surgical 
management with minimally invasive techniques has rendered surgery safer in 
those with limited physiologic reserve. Radiation enhancements, especially 
radiosurgery, have extended the reach and safety of radiation among high-risk 
populations. Finally, the revolution in precision medicine with identification 
of numerous actionable mutations, the advent of immunotherapy, and enhanced 
supportive care have revolutionized the outcomes in patients with advanced lung 
cancer. Older adults who represent a majority of patients battling lung cancer 
have not benefitted to the same extent as their younger counterparts. This 
special population is only expected to grow in coming days. Hence, addressing 
major gaps in the management of older adults with NSCLC and optimizing the care 
are much needed.

BACKGROUND: Deep learning models are increasingly informing medical decision 
making, for instance, in the detection of acute intracranial hemorrhage and 
pulmonary embolism. However, many models are trained on medical image databases 
that poorly represent the diversity of the patients they serve. In turn, many 
artificial intelligence models may not perform as well on assisting providers 
with important medical decisions for underrepresented populations.
PURPOSE: Assessment of the ability of deep learning models to classify the 
self-reported gender, age, self-reported ethnicity, and insurance status of an 
individual patient from a given chest radiograph.
METHODS: Models were trained and tested with 55,174 radiographs in the MIMIC 
Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) database. External validation data came from two 
separate databases, one from CheXpert and another from a multihospital urban 
health care system after institutional review board approval. Macro-averaged 
area under the curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate performance of models. 
Code used for this study is open-source and available at 
https://github.com/ai-bias/cxr-bias, and 
pixelstopatients.com/models/demographics.
RESULTS: Accuracy of models to predict gender was nearly perfect, with 0.999 
(95% confidence interval: 0.99-0.99) AUC on held-out test data and 0.994 
(0.99-0.99) and 0.997 (0.99-0.99) on external validation data. There was high 
accuracy to predict age and ethnicity, ranging from 0.854 (0.80-0.91) to 0.911 
(0.88-0.94) AUC, and moderate accuracy to predict insurance status, with AUC 
ranging from 0.705 (0.60-0.81) on held-out test data to 0.675 (0.54-0.79) on 
external validation data.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning models can predict the age, self-reported gender, 
self-reported ethnicity, and insurance status of a patient from a chest 
radiograph. Visualization techniques are useful to ensure deep learning models 
function as intended and to demonstrate anatomical regions of interest. These 
models can be used to ensure that training data are diverse, thereby ensuring 
artificial intelligence models that work on diverse populations.

The heterogeneity in disease pathology, the unpredictability in disease 
prognosis, and the variability in response to therapy make mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL) a focus of novel therapeutic development. MCL is characterized by 
dysregulated expression of cyclin D1 through a chromosome t(11;14) 
translocation. MCL international prognostic index (MIPI), ki-67 proliferation 
index, and TP53 mutation status are currently utilized for prognostication. With 
advances in pharmacokinetic analysis and drug discovery, treatment strategy has 
evolved from chemotherapy to combination of targeted, epigenetic, and immune 
therapies. In this review, we discuss investigational and newly approved 
treatment approaches. In a short time, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
has approved five agents for the treatment of MCL: lenalidomide, an 
immunomodulatory agent; bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor; and ibrutinib, 
acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib, all Bruton kinase inhibitors. Epigenetic agents 
(e.g. cladribine and vorinostat), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
inhibitors (e.g. temsirolimus and everolimus), and monoclonal antibodies and/or 
antibody-drug conjugates (e.g. obinutuzumab, polatuzumab, and ublituximab) are 
promising therapeutic agents currently under clinical trial investigation. Most 
recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and bispecific T-cell 
engager (BiTE) therapy even open a new venue for MCL treatment. However, due to 
its intricate pathology nature and high relapse incidence, there are still unmet 
needs in developing optimal therapeutic strategies for both frontline and 
relapsed/refractory settings. The ultimate goal is to develop innovative 
personalized combination therapy approaches for the purpose of delivering 
precision medicine to cure this disease.

Update of
    Res Sq. 2023 Feb 14;:

Lithium is regarded as the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), a 
severe and disabling mental health disorder that affects about 1% of the 
population worldwide. Nevertheless, lithium is not consistently effective, with 
only 30% of patients showing a favorable response to treatment. To provide 
personalized treatment options for bipolar patients, it is essential to identify 
prediction biomarkers such as polygenic scores. In this study, we developed a 
polygenic score for lithium treatment response (Li+PGS) in patients with BD. To 
gain further insights into lithium's possible molecular mechanism of action, we 
performed a genome-wide gene-based analysis. Using polygenic score modeling, via 
methods incorporating Bayesian regression and continuous shrinkage priors, 
Li+PGS was developed in the International Consortium of Lithium Genetics cohort 
(ConLi+Gen: N = 2367) and replicated in the combined PsyCourse (N = 89) and 
BipoLife (N = 102) studies. The associations of Li+PGS and lithium treatment 
response - defined in a continuous ALDA scale and a categorical outcome (good 
response vs. poor response) were tested using regression models, each adjusted 
for the covariates: age, sex, and the first four genetic principal components. 
Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05. Li+PGS was positively 
associated with lithium treatment response in the ConLi+Gen cohort, in both the 
categorical (P = 9.8 × 10-12, R2 = 1.9%) and continuous (P = 6.4 × 10-9, 
R2 = 2.6%) outcomes. Compared to bipolar patients in the 1st decile of the risk 
distribution, individuals in the 10th decile had 3.47-fold (95%CI: 2.22-5.47) 
higher odds of responding favorably to lithium. The results were replicated in 
the independent cohorts for the categorical treatment outcome (P = 3.9 × 10-4, 
R2 = 0.9%), but not for the continuous outcome (P = 0.13). Gene-based analyses 
revealed 36 candidate genes that are enriched in biological pathways controlled 
by glutamate and acetylcholine. Li+PGS may be useful in the development of 
pharmacogenomic testing strategies by enabling a classification of bipolar 
patients according to their response to treatment.

Early identification of bipolar disorder may provide appropriate support and 
treatment, however there is no current evidence for statistically predicting 
whether a child will develop bipolar disorder. Machine learning methods offer an 
opportunity for developing empirically-based predictors of bipolar disorder. 
This study examined whether bipolar disorder can be predicted using clinical 
data and machine learning algorithms. 492 children, ages 6-18 at baseline, were 
recruited from longitudinal case-control family studies. Participants were 
assessed at baseline, then followed-up after 10 years. In addition to 
sociodemographic data, children were assessed with psychometric scales, 
structured diagnostic interviews, and cognitive and social functioning 
assessments. Using the Balanced Random Forest algorithm, we examined whether the 
diagnostic outcome of full or subsyndromal bipolar disorder could be predicted 
from baseline data. 45 children (10%) developed bipolar disorder at follow-up. 
The model predicted subsequent bipolar disorder with 75% sensitivity, 76% 
specificity, and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics of 75%. 
Predictors best differentiating between children who did or did not develop 
bipolar disorder were the Child Behavioral Checklist Externalizing and 
Internalizing behaviors, the Child Behavioral Checklist Total t-score, 
problematic school functions indexed through the Child Behavioral Checklist 
School Competence scale, and the Child Behavioral Checklist Anxiety/Depression 
and Aggression scales. Our study provides the first quantitative model to 
predict bipolar disorder. Longitudinal prediction may help clinicians assess 
children with emergent psychopathology for future risk of bipolar disorder, an 
area of clinical and scientific importance. Machine learning algorithms could be 
implemented to alert clinicians to risk for bipolar disorder.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) impact multiple aspects of an individual's 
functioning, including social interactions, communication, and behaviors. The 
underlying biological mechanisms of NDDs are not yet fully understood, and 
pharmacological treatments have been limited in their effectiveness, in part due 
to the complex nature of these disorders and the heterogeneity of symptoms 
across individuals. Identifying genetic loci associated with NDDs can help in 
understanding biological mechanisms and potentially lead to the development of 
new treatments. However, the polygenic nature of these complex disorders has 
made identifying new treatment targets from genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) challenging. Recent advances in the fields of big data and 
high-throughput tools have provided radically new insights into the underlying 
biological mechanism of NDDs. This paper reviews various big data approaches, 
including classical and more recent techniques like deep learning, which can 
identify potential treatment targets from GWAS and other omics data, with a 
particular emphasis on NDDs. We also emphasize the increasing importance of 
explainable and causal machine learning (ML) methods that can aid in identifying 
genes, molecular pathways, and more complex biological processes that may be 
future targets of intervention in these disorders. We conclude that these new 
developments in genetics and ML hold promise for advancing our understanding of 
NDDs and identifying novel treatment targets.

Current therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer disease (AD) remain disappointing 
and, hence, there is an urgent need for effective treatments. Here, we provide a 
perspective review on the emerging role of "metabolic inflammation" and stress 
as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD and propose a novel rationale for 
correction of metabolic inflammation, increase resilience and potentially 
slow-down or halt the progression of the neurodegenerative process. Based on 
recent evidence and observations of an early pilot trial, we posit a potential 
use of extracorporeal apheresis in the prevention and treatment of AD. 
Apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein(a), oxidized LDL (low density lipoprotein)'s and 
large LDL particles, as well as other proinflammatory lipids and stress hormones 
such as cortisol, have been recognized as key factors in amyloid plaque 
formation and aggravation of AD. Extracorporeal lipoprotein apheresis systems 
employ well-established, powerful methods to provide an acute, reliable 60-80% 
reduction in the circulating concentration of these lipid classes and reduce 
acute cortisol levels. Following a double-membrane extracorporeal apheresis in 
patients with AD, there was a significant reduction of proinflammatory lipids, 
circulating cytokines, immune complexes, proinflammatory metals and toxic 
chaperones in patients with AD. On the basis of the above, we suggest designing 
clinical trials to assess the promising potential of such "cerebropheresis" 
treatment in patients with AD and, possibly, other neurodegenerative diseases.

The widespread adoption of high-throughput omics technologies has exponentially 
increased the amount of protein sequence data involved in many salient disease 
pathways and their respective therapeutics and diagnostics. Despite the 
availability of large-scale sequence data, the lack of experimental fitness 
annotations underpins the need for self-supervised and unsupervised machine 
learning (ML) methods. These techniques leverage the meaningful features encoded 
in abundant unlabeled sequences to accomplish complex protein engineering tasks. 
Proficiency in the rapidly evolving fields of protein engineering and generative 
AI is required to realize the full potential of ML models as a tool for protein 
fitness landscape navigation. Here, we support this work by (i) providing an 
overview of the architecture and mathematical details of the most successful ML 
models applicable to sequence data (e.g. variational autoencoders, 
autoregressive models, generative adversarial neural networks, and diffusion 
models), (ii) guiding how to effectively implement these models on protein 
sequence data to predict fitness or generate high-fitness sequences and (iii) 
highlighting several successful studies that implement these techniques in 
protein engineering (from paratope regions and subcellular localization 
prediction to high-fitness sequences and protein design rules generation). By 
providing a comprehensive survey of model details, novel architecture 
developments, comparisons of model applications, and current challenges, this 
study intends to provide structured guidance and robust framework for delivering 
a prospective outlook in the ML-driven protein engineering field.

BACKGROUND: Although renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is believed to have a strong 
hereditary component, there is a paucity of published guidelines for genetic 
risk assessment. A panel of experts was convened to gauge current opinions.
METHODS: A North American multidisciplinary panel with expertise in hereditary 
RCC, including urologists, medical oncologists, clinical geneticists, genetic 
counselors, and patient advocates, was convened. Before the summit, a modified 
Delphi methodology was used to generate, review, and curate a set of consensus 
questions regarding RCC genetic risk assessment. Uniform consensus was defined 
as ≥85% agreement on particular questions.
RESULTS: Thirty-three panelists, including urologists (n = 13), medical 
oncologists (n = 12), genetic counselors and clinical geneticists (n = 6), and 
patient advocates (n = 2), reviewed 53 curated consensus questions. Uniform 
consensus was achieved on 30 statements in specific areas that addressed for 
whom, what, when, and how genetic testing should be performed. Topics of 
consensus included the family history criteria, which should trigger further 
assessment, the need for risk assessment in those with bilateral or multifocal 
disease and/or specific histology, the utility of multigene panel testing, and 
acceptance of clinician-based counseling and testing by those who have 
experience with hereditary RCC.
CONCLUSIONS: In the first ever consensus panel on RCC genetic risk assessment, 
30 consensus statements were reached. Areas that require further research and 
discussion were also identified, with a second future meeting planned. This 
consensus statement may provide further guidance for clinicians when considering 
RCC genetic risk assessment.
LAY SUMMARY: The contribution of germline genetics to the development of renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) has long been recognized. However, there is a paucity of 
guidelines to define how and when genetic risk assessment should be performed 
for patients with known or suspected hereditary RCC. Without guidelines, 
clinicians struggle to define who requires further evaluation, when risk 
assessment or testing should be done, which genes should be considered, and how 
counseling and/or testing should be performed. To this end, a multidisciplinary 
panel of national experts was convened to gauge current opinion on genetic risk 
assessment in RCC and to enumerate a set of recommendations to guide clinicians 
when evaluating individuals with suspected hereditary kidney cancer.

In the past few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven 
powerful in extracting image features crucial for medical image registration. 
However, challenging applications and recent advances in computer vision suggest 
that CNNs are limited in their ability to understand the spatial correspondence 
between features, which is at the core of image registration. The issue is 
further exaggerated when it comes to multi-modal image registration, where the 
appearances of input images can differ significantly. This paper presents a 
novel cross-modal attention mechanism for correlating features extracted from 
the multi-modal input images and mapping such correlation to image registration 
transformation. To efficiently train the developed network, a contrastive 
learning-based pre-training method is also proposed to aid the network in 
extracting high-level features across the input modalities for the following 
cross-modal attention learning. We validated the proposed method on transrectal 
ultrasound (TRUS) to magnetic resonance (MR) registration, a clinically 
important procedure that benefits prostate cancer biopsy. Our experimental 
results demonstrate that for MR-TRUS registration, a deep neural network 
embedded with the cross-modal attention block outperforms other advanced 
CNN-based networks with ten times its size. We also incorporated visualization 
techniques to improve the interpretability of our network, which helps bring 
insights into the deep learning based image registration methods. The source 
code of our work is available at https://github.com/DIAL-RPI/Attention-Reg.

Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel 
between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and 
decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and 
evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare 
staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in 
April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) 
collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific 
predictions from more than 90 different academic, industry, and independent 
research groups. A multimodel ensemble forecast that combined predictions from 
dozens of groups every week provided the most consistently accurate 
probabilistic forecasts of incident deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and 
national level from April 2020 through October 2021. The performance of 27 
individual models that submitted complete forecasts of COVID-19 deaths 
consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill 
across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Two-thirds of the models 
evaluated showed better accuracy than a naïve baseline model. Forecast accuracy 
degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic 
error at a 20-wk horizon three to five times larger than when predicting at a 
1-wk horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active 
coordination between governmental public-health agencies, academic modeling 
teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities 
to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.

BACKGROUND. Deep learning-based convolutional neural networks have enabled major 
advances in development of artificial intelligence (AI) software applications. 
Modern AI applications offer comprehensive multiorgan evaluation. OBJECTIVE. The 
purpose of this article was to evaluate the impact of an automated AI platform 
integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT interpretation on radiologists' 
interpretation times when evaluated in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS. 
In this prospective single-center study, a commercial AI software solution was 
integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT interpretation. The software 
provided automated analysis of cardiac, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal findings, 
including labeling, segmenting, and measuring normal structures as well as 
detecting, labeling, and measuring abnormalities. AI-annotated images and 
autogenerated summary results were stored in the PACS and available to 
interpreting radiologists. A total of 390 patients (204 women, 186 men; mean 
age, 62.8 ± 13.3 [SD] years) who underwent out-patient chest CT between January 
19, 2021, and January 28, 2021, were included. Scans were randomized using 1:1 
allocation between AI-assisted and non-AI-assisted arms and were clinically 
interpreted by one of three cardiothoracic radiologists (65 scans per arm per 
radiologist; total of 195 scans per arm) who recorded interpretation times using 
a stopwatch. Findings were categorized according to review of report 
impressions. Interpretation times were compared between arms. RESULTS. Mean 
interpretation times were significantly shorter in the AI-assisted than in the 
non-AI-assisted arm for all three readers (289 ± 89 vs 344 ± 129 seconds, p < 
.001; 449 ± 110 vs 649 ± 82 seconds, p < .001; 281 ± 114 vs 348 ± 93 seconds, p 
= .01) and for readers combined (328 ± 122 vs 421 ± 175 seconds, p < .001). For 
readers combined, the mean difference was 93 seconds (95% CI, 63-123 seconds), 
corresponding with a 22.1% reduction in the AI-assisted arm. Mean interpretation 
time was also shorter in the AI-assisted arm compared with the non-AI-assisted 
arm for contrast-enhanced scans (83 seconds), noncontrast scans (104 seconds), 
negative scans (84 seconds), positive scans without significant new findings 
(117 seconds), and positive scans with significant new findings (92 seconds). 
CONCLUSION. Cardiothoracic radiologists exhibited a 22.1% reduction in chest CT 
interpretations times when they had access to results from an automated AI 
support platform during real-world clinical practice. CLINICAL IMPACT. 
Integration of the AI support platform into clinical workflow improved 
radiologist efficiency.

Recent discoveries have provided valuable insight into the genomic landscape of 
pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) at diagnosis, facilitating molecularly 
targeted treatment. However, little is known about their temporal and 
therapy-related genomic heterogeneity. An adequate understanding of the 
evolution of pediatric LGGs' genomic profiles over time is critically important 
in guiding decisions about targeted therapeutics and diagnostic biopsy at 
recurrence. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, mutation-specific 
immunohistochemistry, and/or targeted sequencing were performed on paired tumor 
samples from primary diagnostic and subsequent surgeries. Ninety-four tumor 
samples from 45 patients (41 with two specimens, four with three specimens) from 
three institutions underwent testing. Conservation of BRAF fusion, BRAFV600E 
mutation, and FGFR1 rearrangement status was observed in 100%, 98%, and 96% of 
paired specimens, respectively. No loss or gain of IDH1 mutations or NTRK2, MYB, 
or MYBL1 rearrangements were detected over time. Histologic diagnosis remained 
the same in all tumors, with no acquired H3K27M mutations or malignant 
transformation. Changes in CDKN2A deletion status at recurrence occurred in 11 
patients (42%), with acquisition of hemizygous CDKN2A deletion in seven and loss 
in four. Shorter time to progression and shorter time to subsequent surgery were 
observed among patients with acquired CDKN2A deletions compared to patients 
without acquisition of this alteration [median time to progression: 5.5 versus 
16.0 months (p = 0.048); median time to next surgery: 17.0 months versus 
29.0 months (p = 0.031)]. Most targetable genetic aberrations in pediatric LGGs, 
including BRAF alterations, are conserved at recurrence and following 
chemotherapy or irradiation. However, changes in CDKN2A deletion status over 
time were demonstrated. Acquisition of CDKN2A deletion may define a higher risk 
subgroup of pediatric LGGs with a poorer prognosis. Given the potential for 
targeted therapies for tumors harboring CDKN2A deletions, biopsy at recurrence 
may be indicated in certain patients, especially those with rapid progression.

BACKGROUND: Ameloblastoma may present a significant treatment challenge in the 
locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic setting. Comprehensive genomic 
profiling (CGP) can identify targetable genomic alterations to aid in treatment.
METHODS: Ameloblastoma samples were sequenced using hybrid-capture based 
sequencing. A systematic literature review was performed to examine outcomes in 
studies employing targeted treatment in ameloblastoma.
RESULTS: We reviewed 14 cases of Ameloblastoma using CGP. There were six 
patients with activating BRAF mutations, five with PIK3CA, five with SMO, four 
with FGFR2, one with EGFR, and one with ROS1. All cases were MSI stable and the 
median TMB was 2.5 mutations/Mb. A separate literature review of clinical 
outcomes in ameloblastoma showed a predominance of at least partial response to 
targeted treatment (7/12 cases).
CONCLUSION: CGP is helpful in identifying specific driver mutations in patients 
with complex ameloblastoma. Targeted treatment has been employed with success in 
achieving treatment response.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by a spectrum of 
social and communication impairments and rigid and stereotyped behaviors that 
have a neurodevelopmental origin. Although many imaging studies have reported 
structural and functional alterations in multiple brain regions, clinically 
useful diagnostic imaging biomarkers for ASD remain unavailable.
METHODS: In this study, we applied machine learning (ML) models to regional 
volumetric and cortical thickness data from the largest structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (sMRI) dataset available from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging 
Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium (1833 subjects with ASD and 
1838 without ASD; age range: 1.5-64; average age: 15.6; male/female ratio: 
4.2:1).
RESULTS: The highest classification accuracy on a hold-out test set was achieved 
using a stacked Extra Tree Classifier. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57, 
0.68) and the area under the precision-recall curve was 0.58. Learning curve 
analysis showed the good fit of the model and suggests that more training 
examples will not likely benefit model performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sMRI volumetric and cortical thickness 
data alone may not provide clinically sufficient useful diagnostic biomarkers 
for ASD. Developing clinically useful imaging classifiers for ASD will benefit 
from combining other data modalities or feature types, such as functional MRI 
data and raw images that can leverage other machine learning (ML) techniques 
such as convolutional neural networks.

Interpretability Versus Accuracy: A Comparison of Machine Learning Models Built 
Using Different Algorithms, Performance Measures, and Features to Predict E. 
coli Levels in Agricultural Water.

Since E. coli is considered a fecal indicator in surface water, government water 
quality standards and industry guidance often rely on E. coli monitoring to 
identify when there is an increased risk of pathogen contamination of water used 
for produce production (e.g., for irrigation). However, studies have indicated 
that E. coli testing can present an economic burden to growers and that time 
lags between sampling and obtaining results may reduce the utility of these 
data. Models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may provide a 
mechanism for overcoming these obstacles. Thus, this proof-of-concept study uses 
previously published datasets to train, test, and compare E. coli predictive 
models using multiple algorithms and performance measures. Since the collection 
of different feature data carries specific costs for growers, predictive 
performance was compared for models built using different feature types 
[geospatial, water quality, stream traits, and/or weather features]. Model 
performance was assessed against baseline regression models. Model performance 
varied considerably with root-mean-squared errors and Kendall's Tau ranging 
between 0.37 and 1.03, and 0.07 and 0.55, respectively. Overall, models that 
included turbidity, rain, and temperature outperformed all other models 
regardless of the algorithm used. Turbidity and weather factors were also found 
to drive model accuracy even when other feature types were included in the 
model. These findings confirm previous conclusions that machine learning models 
may be useful for predicting when, where, and at what level E. coli (and 
associated hazards) are likely to be present in preharvest agricultural water 
sources. This study also identifies specific algorithm-predictor combinations 
that should be the foci of future efforts to develop deployable models (i.e., 
models that can be used to guide on-farm decision-making and risk mitigation). 
When deploying E. coli predictive models in the field, it is important to note 
that past research indicates an inconsistent relationship between E. coli levels 
and foodborne pathogen presence. Thus, models that predict E. coli levels in 
agricultural water may be useful for assessing fecal contamination status and 
ensuring compliance with regulations but should not be used to assess the risk 
that specific pathogens of concern (e.g., Salmonella, Listeria) are present.

Evolution of the vertebrate urinary system occurs in response to numerous 
selective pressures, which have been incompletely characterized. Developing 
research into urinary evolution led to the occurrence of clinical applications 
and insights in paediatric urology, reproductive medicine, urolithiasis and 
other domains. Each nephron segment and urinary organ has functions that can be 
contextualized within an evolutionary framework. For example, the structure and 
function of the glomerulus and proximal tubule are highly conserved, enabling 
blood cells and proteins to be retained, and facilitating the elimination of 
oceanic Ca+ and Mg+. Urea emerged as an osmotic mediator during evolution, as 
cells of large organisms required increased precision in the internal regulation 
of salinity and solutes. As the first vertebrates moved from water to land, 
acid-base regulation was shifted from gills to skin and kidneys in amphibians. 
In reptiles and birds, solute regulation no longer occurred through the skin but 
through nasal salt glands and post-renally, within the cloaca and the rectum. In 
placental mammals, nasal salt glands are absent and the rectum and urinary 
tracts became separate, which limited post-renal urine concentration and led to 
the necessity of a kidney capable of high urine concentration. Considering the 
evolutionary and environmental selective pressures that have contributed to 
renal evolution can help to gain an increased understanding of renal physiology.

Up to one-third of patients selected by current guidelines do not respond to 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), the aim of this study was to find out 
novel analytical approaches to improve pre-implantation CRT response prediction. 
Among 31 pre-implantation features of clinical, laboratory, electrocardiography 
(ECG), and echocardiography variables in a consecutive cohort of patients 
receiving a first-time CRT device (CRT-pacemaker or CRT-defibrillator), we 
developed a machine learning (ML) model with three classification algorithms 
(support vector machines (SVM), K nearest neighbors, and random subspaces) with 
the best features combination to predict CRT response. Three categorical 
variables, left bundle branch block (LBBB), nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and 
female gender, were independently associated with CRT responses. Among 
continuous variables, including septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, 
and relative wall thickness (RWT), could regularize ECG QRS duration (QRSd) and 
significantly enhance the correlation between QRSd and CRT response. The 3 ML 
algorithms in a total of 38 features combinations constantly recognized that the 
features combined with QRSd/RWT outperformed the combinations without it. For 
each of three algorithms, the triplet feature combination of QRSd/RWT, LBBB, and 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy repeatedly increased the classification rate more 
than 8%. The best performance for CRT response prediction occurred with SVM 
model, which proposed actual QRSd/RWT values that favored CRT responses in 
patients both with and without LBBB. Lower QRSd/RWT values were required for CRT 
responses in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy compared to those with 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. ML from ventricular remodeling 
characteristics-regularized QRSd improves CRT response prediction.

RAF family protein kinases signal through the MAPK pathway to orchestrate 
cellular proliferation, survival, and transformation. Identifying BRAF 
alterations in pediatric cancers is critically important as therapeutic agents 
targeting BRAF or MEK may be incorporated into the clinical management of these 
patients. In this study, we performed comprehensive genomic profiling on 3,633 
pediatric cancer samples and identified a cohort of 221 (6.1%) cases with known 
or novel alterations in BRAF or RAF1 detected in extracranial solid tumors, 
brain tumors, or hematological malignancies. Eighty percent (176/221) of these 
tumors had a known-activating short variant (98, 55.7%), fusion (72, 40.9%), or 
insertion/deletion (6, 3.4%). Among BRAF altered cancers, the most common tumor 
types were brain tumors (74.4%), solid tumors (10.8%), hematological 
malignancies (9.1%), sarcomas (3.4%), and extracranial embryonal tumors (2.3%). 
RAF1 fusions containing intact RAF1 kinase domain (encoded by exons 10-17) were 
identified in seven tumors, including two novel fusions TMF1-RAF1 and SOX6-RAF1. 
Additionally, we highlight a subset of patients with brain tumor with positive 
clinical response to BRAF inhibitors, demonstrating the rationale for 
incorporating precision medicine into pediatric oncology. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
PRACTICE: Precision medicine has not yet gained a strong foothold in pediatric 
cancers. This study describes the landscape of BRAF and RAF1 genomic alterations 
across a diverse spectrum of pediatric cancers, primarily brain tumors, but also 
encompassing melanoma, sarcoma, several types of hematologic malignancy, and 
others. Given the availability of multiple U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration-approved BRAF inhibitors, identification of these alterations may 
assist with treatment decision making, as described here in three cases of 
pediatric cancer.

BACKGROUND: Standardized validation indices (i.e., accuracy, bias, and 
precision) provide a comprehensive comparison of step counting wearable 
technologies.
PURPOSE: To expand a previously published child/youth catalog of validity 
indices to include adults (21-40, 41-60 and 61-85 years of age) assessed across 
a range of treadmill speeds (slow [0.8-3.2 km/h], normal [4.0-6.4 km/h], fast 
[7.2-8.0 km/h]) and device wear locations (ankle, thigh, waist, and wrist).
METHODS: Two hundred fifty-eight adults (52.5 ± 18.7 years, 49.6% female) 
participated in this laboratory-based study and performed a series of 5-min 
treadmill bouts while wearing multiple devices; 21 devices in total were 
evaluated over the course of this multi-year cross-sectional study (2015-2019). 
The criterion measure was directly observed steps. Computed validity indices 
included accuracy (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE), bias (mean percentage 
error, MPE), and precision (correlation coefficient, r; standard deviation, SD; 
coefficient of variation, CoV).
RESULTS: Over the range of normal speeds, 15 devices (Actical, waist-worn 
ActiGraph GT9X, activPAL, Apple Watch Series 1, Fitbit Ionic, Fitbit One, Fitbit 
Zip, Garmin vivoactive 3, Garmin vivofit 3, waist-worn GENEActiv, NL-1000, 
PiezoRx, Samsung Gear Fit2, Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro, and StepWatch) performed 
at < 5% MAPE. The wrist-worn ActiGraph GT9X displayed the worst accuracy across 
normal speeds (MAPE = 52%). On average, accuracy was compromised across slow 
walking speeds for all wearable technologies (MAPE = 40%) while all performed 
best across normal speeds (MAPE = 7%). When analyzing the data by wear 
locations, the ankle and thigh demonstrated the best accuracy (both MAPE = 1%), 
followed by the waist (3%) and the wrist (15%) across normal speeds. There were 
significant effects of speed, wear location, and age group on accuracy and bias 
(both p < 0.001) and precision (p ≤ 0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: Standardized validation indices cataloged by speed, wear location, 
and age group across the adult lifespan facilitate selecting, evaluating, or 
comparing performance of step counting wearable technologies. Speed, wear 
location, and age displayed a significant effect on accuracy, bias, and 
precision. Overall, reduced performance was associated with very slow walking 
speeds (0.8 to 3.2 km/h). Ankle- and thigh-located devices logged the highest 
accuracy, while those located at the wrist reported the worst accuracy.

Using exome sequencing for biomarker discovery and precision medicine requires 
connecting nucleotide-level variation with functional changes in encoded 
proteins. However, for functionally annotating the thousands of 
cancer-associated missense mutations, or variants of uncertain significance 
(VUS), purifying variant proteins for biochemical and functional analysis is 
cost-prohibitive and inefficient. We describe parallel functional annotation 
(PFA) of large numbers of VUS using small cultures and crude extracts in 96-well 
plates. Using members of a histone methyltransferase family, we demonstrate 
high-throughput structural and functional annotation of cancer-associated 
mutations. By combining functional annotation of paralogs, we discovered two 
phylogenetic and clustering parameters that improve the accuracy of 
sequence-based functional predictions to over 90%. Our results demonstrate the 
value of PFA for defining oncogenic/tumor suppressor functions of histone 
methyltransferases as well as enhancing the accuracy of sequence-based 
algorithms in predicting the effects of cancer-associated mutations.

Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is predominantly a slow-growing 
malignancy, amendable to treatment, and has an excellent prognosis following 
thyroidectomy and radioiodine (RAI) therapy. However, patients who fail the 
initial RAI treatment attempt may require repeated RAI or other treatments and 
with this, comes an associated impact on patient quality of life. Therefore, the 
anticipation of patients in whom there is a higher risk of RAI failure may help 
in patient risk stratification and subsequent management. We conducted a 
retrospective review to determine the factors associated with initial RAI 
therapy failure in well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients. Using 
scikit-learn from Python, we implemented a machine-learning algorithm to 
determine the clinical patient factors associated with a higher likelihood of 
treatment resistance. We found that clinical factors such as tumor focality (P = 
0.026) and lymph node invasion at surgical resection (P = 0.0135) were 
significantly associated with initial treatment failure following RAI. Elevated 
serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and Tg antibody levels following surgery but before RAI 
were also associated with treatment resistance (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.011 
respectively). Less expected factors such as decreased time from surgery to RAI 
were also associated with treatment failure, however not to a statistically 
significant degree (P > 0.064). Clinical outcomes following RAI can be 
stratified by identifying factors that are associated with initial treatment 
failure. These findings can help restratify patients for RAI treatment and 
change patient management in certain cases. Such stratification will ultimately 
help to optimize successful treatment outcomes and improve patient quality of 
life.

The clinical similarity among different neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) 
suggested a shared genetic basis. We catalogued 23,109 coding de novo mutations 
(DNMs) from 6511 patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 4,293 undiagnosed 
developmental disorder (UDD), 933 epileptic encephalopathy (EE), 1022 
intellectual disability (ID), 1094 schizophrenia (SCZ), and 3391 controls. We 
evaluated that putative functional DNMs contribute to 38.11%, 34.40%, 33.31%, 
10.98% and 6.91% of patients with ID, EE, UDD, ASD and SCZ, respectively. 
Consistent with phenotype similarity and heterogeneity in different NPDs, they 
show different degree of genetic association. Cross-disorder analysis of DNMs 
prioritized 321 candidate genes (FDR < 0.05) and showed that genes shared in 
more disorders were more likely to exhibited specific expression pattern, 
functional pathway, genetic convergence, and genetic intolerance.

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are common in children with neurodevelopmental 
disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A limited understanding of the 
biologic factors that predispose this population to GI disorders has prevented 
development of individualized therapies to address this important medical issue. 
The goal of the current study was to determine if elements of the salivary 
micro-transcriptome could provide insight into the biologic perturbations unique 
to children with ASD-related GI disturbance. This cohort study included 898 
children (ages 18-73 months) with ASD, non-ASD developmental delay (DD), or 
typical development (TD). The saliva micro-transcriptome of each child was 
assessed with RNA-seq. Outputs were aligned to microbial and human databases. A 
Kruskal Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare levels of 1821 
micro-transcriptome features across neurodevelopmental status (ASD, DD, or TD) 
and GI presence or absence. An ANOVA was also used to compare 
micro-transcriptome levels among GI sub-groups (constipation, reflux, food 
intolerance, other GI condition, no GI condition), and to identify RNAs that 
differed among children taking three common GI medications (probiotics, reflux 
medication, or laxatives). Relationships between features identified in ANOVA 
testing were examined for associations with scores on the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition (ADOS-2) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
Scales. GI disturbance rates were higher among children with ASD than peers with 
TD but were similar to those with DD. Five piwi-interacting RNAs and three 
microbial RNAs displayed an interaction between developmental status and GI 
disturbance. Fifty-seven salivary RNAs differed between GI sub-groups-with 
microRNA differences between food intolerance and reflux groups being most 
common. Twelve microRNAs displayed an effect of GI disturbance and showed 
association with GI medication uses and measures of behavior. These 12 microRNAs 
displayed enrichment for 13 physiologic pathways, including metabolism/digestion 
long-term depression, and neurobiology of addiction. This study identifies 
salivary micro-transcriptome features with differential expression among 
children with ASD-related GI disturbance. A subset of the RNAs displays 
relationships with treatment modality and are associated with autistic 
behaviors. The pathobiologic targets of the micro-transcriptome markers may 
serve as targets for individualized therapeutic interventions aimed at easing 
pain and behavioral difficulties seen in ASD-related GI disturbance.

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has killed almost two 
million people worldwide and over 400 thousand in the United States (US). As the 
pandemic evolves, informed policy-making and strategic resource allocation 
relies on accurate forecasts. To predict the spread of the virus within US 
counties, we curated an array of county-level demographic and COVID-19-relevant 
health risk factors. In combination with the county-level case and death numbers 
curated by John Hopkins university, we developed a forecasting model using deep 
learning (DL). We implemented an autoencoder-based Seq2Seq model with gated 
recurrent units (GRUs) in the deep recurrent layers. We trained the model to 
predict future incident cases, deaths and the reproductive number, R For most 
counties, it makes accurate predictions of new incident cases, deaths and R 
values, up to 30 days in the future. Our framework can also be used to predict 
other targets that are useful indices for policymaking, for example 
hospitalization or the occupancy of intensive care units. Our DL framework is 
publicly available on GitHub and can be adapted for other indices of the 
COVID-19 spread. We hope that our forecasts and model can help local governments 
in the continued fight against COVID-19.

The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are 
based on clinical assessments of symptoms. In this pilot study, we applied 
high-throughput antibody-based protein profiling to serum samples of healthy 
controls and individuals with SCZ and BD with the aim of identifying 
differentially expressed proteins in these disorders. Moreover, we explored the 
influence of polygenic burden for SCZ and BD on the serum levels of these 
proteins. Serum samples from 113 individuals with SCZ and 125 with BD from the 
PsyCourse Study and from 44 healthy controls were analyzed by using a set of 155 
antibodies in an antibody-based assay targeting a selected panel of 95 proteins. 
For the cases, genotyping and imputation were conducted for DNA samples and SCZ 
and BD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated. Univariate linear and 
logistic models were used for association analyses. The comparison between SCZ 
and BD revealed two serum proteins that were significantly elevated in BD after 
multiple testing adjustment: "complement C9" and "Interleukin 1 Receptor 
Accessory Protein". Moreover, the first principal component of variance in the 
proteomics dataset differed significantly between SCZ and BD. After multiple 
testing correction, SCZ-PRS, BD-PRS, and SCZ-vs-BD-PRS were not significantly 
associated with the levels of the individual proteins or the values of the 
proteome principal components indicating no detectable genetic effects. Overall, 
our findings contribute to the evidence suggesting that the analysis of 
circulating proteins could lead to the identification of distinctive biomarkers 
for SCZ and BD. Our investigation warrants replication in large-scale studies to 
confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Genomics enables individualized diagnosis and treatment, but large 
challenges remain to functionally interpret rare variants. To date, only one 
causative variant has been described for KCNK9 imprinting syndrome (KIS). The 
genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of KIS has yet to be described and the precise 
mechanism of disease fully understood.
METHODS: This study discovers mechanisms underlying KCNK9 imprinting syndrome 
(KIS) by describing 15 novel KCNK9 alterations from 47 KIS-affected individuals. 
We use clinical genetics and computer-assisted facial phenotyping to describe 
the phenotypic spectrum of KIS. We then interrogate the functional effects of 
the variants in the encoded TASK3 channel using sequence-based analysis, 3D 
molecular mechanic and dynamic protein modeling, and in vitro 
electrophysiological and functional methodologies.
RESULTS: We describe the broader genetic and phenotypic variability for KIS in a 
cohort of individuals identifying an additional mutational hotspot at p.Arg131 
and demonstrating the common features of this neurodevelopmental disorder to 
include motor and speech delay, intellectual disability, early feeding 
difficulties, muscular hypotonia, behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic 
features. The computational protein modeling and in vitro electrophysiological 
studies discover variability of the impact of KCNK9 variants on TASK3 channel 
function identifying variants causing gain and others causing loss of 
conductance. The most consistent functional impact of KCNK9 genetic variants, 
however, was altered channel regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study extends our understanding of KIS mechanisms 
demonstrating its complex etiology including gain and loss of channel function 
and consistent loss of channel regulation. These data are rapidly applicable to 
diagnostic strategies, as KIS is not identifiable from clinical features alone 
and thus should be molecularly diagnosed. Furthermore, our data suggests unique 
therapeutic strategies may be needed to address the specific functional 
consequences of KCNK9 variation on channel function and regulation.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment through blood component sampling by 
liquid biopsies (LBs) is increasingly being investigated in myeloid 
malignancies. Blood components then undergo molecular analysis by flow cytometry 
or sequencing techniques and can be used as a powerful tool for prognostic and 
predictive purposes in myeloid malignancies. There is evidence and more is 
evolving about the quantification and identification of cell-based and 
gene-based biomarkers in myeloid malignancies to monitor treatment response. MRD 
based acute myeloid leukemia protocol and clinical trials are currently 
incorporating LB testing and preliminary results are encouraging for potential 
widespread use in clinic in the near future. MRD monitoring using LBs are not 
standard in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) but this is an area of active 
investigation. In the future, LBs can replace more invasive techniques such as 
bone marrow biopsies. However, the routine clinical application of these markers 
continues to be an issue due to lack of standardization and limited number of 
studies investigating their specificities. Integrating artificial intelligence 
(AI) could help simplify the complex interpretation of molecular testing and 
reduce errors related to operator dependency. Though the field is rapidly 
evolving, the applicability of MRD testing using LB is mostly limited to 
research setting at this time due to the need for validation, regulatory 
approval, payer coverage, and cost issues. This review focuses on the types of 
biomarkers, most recent research exploring MRD and LB in myeloid malignancies, 
ongoing clinical trials, and the future of LB in the setting of AI.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Robotic pyeloplasty is still a relatively novel procedure. 
Clinically, early studies have shown high success rates, decreased complication 
rates, decreased length of hospital stay, and better cosmetic results. This goal 
of this article is to argue for the use of robotic pyeloplasty as the gold 
standard of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) treatment. Results of 
studies that have compared robotic pyeloplasty with other procedures currently 
used are reviewed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Our study, a comprehensive review of published outcomes of 
robotic pyeloplasty and alternative therapies, consisted of 666 pediatric 
patients and 653 adult patients. Our review coincided with the previously 
established studies that robotic pyeloplasty shows equivalent surgical success 
rates as previous standard of care treatments. Open pyeloplasty has fallen out 
of favor as standard of care due to the increased length of hospital stay, 
increased adverse events, and the undesirable aesthetics.
SUMMARY: The use of robotic pyeloplasty has shown to have clinical outcomes that 
are consistent with other intervention for UPJO, with a potential decrease in 
length of stay and morbidity. More work has to be done to develop ways to 
decrease cost of the robot to help establish it as the gold standard for UPJO 
treatment.

Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental 
syndrome that has been studied intensively in order to understand relationships 
between the genetic microdeletion, brain development, cognitive function, and 
the emergence of psychiatric symptoms. White matter microstructural 
abnormalities identified using diffusion tensor imaging methods have been 
reported to affect a variety of neuroanatomical tracts in 22q11.2DS. In the 
present study, we sought to combine two discovery-based approaches: (1) white 
matter query language was used to parcellate the brain's white matter into 
tracts connecting pairs of 34, bilateral cortical regions and (2) the diffusion 
imaging characteristics of the resulting tracts were analyzed using a 
machine-learning method called support vector machine in order to optimize the 
selection of a set of imaging features that maximally discriminated 22q11.2DS 
and comparison subjects. With this unique approach, we both confirmed 
previously-recognized 22q11.2DS-related abnormalities in the inferior 
longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and identified, for the first time, 
22q11.2DS-related anomalies in the middle longitudinal fascicle and the extreme 
capsule, which may have been overlooked in previous, hypothesis-guided studies. 
We further observed that, in participants with 22q11.2DS, ILF metrics were 
significantly associated with positive prodromal symptoms of psychosis.

Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and 
well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some 
romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used 
machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which 
relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably 
predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 
laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality 
were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, 
perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference 
predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment 
avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables 
predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the 
end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, 
respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and 
individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than 
partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). 
Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive 
effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These 
findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner 
experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own 
relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual 
differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, 
relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship 
quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any 
combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future 
models of relationships.

BACKGROUND: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a 
high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). Early identification of at-risk 
youth would help allocate scarce resources for prevention programs.
METHODS: Psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, family history of these disorders, 
measures of socioeconomic distress, and information about birth complications 
were obtained from the national registers in Sweden for 19,787 children with 
ADHD born between 1989 and 1993. We trained (a) a cross-sectional random forest 
(RF) model using data available by age 17 to predict SUD diagnosis between ages 
18 and 19; and (b) a longitudinal recurrent neural network (RNN) model with the 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to predict new diagnoses at each age.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 
0.73(95%CI 0.70-0.76) for the random forest model (RF). Removing prior diagnosis 
from the predictors, the RF model was still able to achieve significant AUCs 
when predicting all SUD diagnoses (0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.72) or new diagnoses 
(0.67, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.71) during age 18-19. For the model predicting new 
diagnoses, model calibration was good with a low Brier score of 0.086. 
Longitudinal LSTM model was able to predict later SUD risks at as early as 
2 years age, 10 years before the earliest diagnosis. The average AUC from 
longitudinal models predicting new diagnoses 1, 2, 5 and 10 years in the future 
was 0.63.
CONCLUSIONS: Population registry data can be used to predict at-risk comorbid 
SUDs in individuals with ADHD. Such predictions can be made many years prior to 
age of the onset, and their SUD risks can be monitored using longitudinal models 
over years during child development. Nevertheless, more work is needed to create 
prediction models based on electronic health records or linked population 
registers that are sufficiently accurate for use in the clinic.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in medical care have increased life expectancy and 
improved the quality of life for people with Down syndrome (DS). These advances 
are the result of both pre-clinical and clinical research but much about DS is 
still poorly understood. In 2020, the NIH announced their plan to update their 
DS research plan and requested input from the scientific and advocacy community.
OBJECTIVE: The National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) and the LuMind IDSC 
Foundation worked together with scientific and medical experts to develop 
recommendations for the NIH research plan.
METHODS: NDSS and LuMind IDSC assembled over 50 experts across multiple 
disciplines and organized them in eleven working groups focused on specific 
issues for people with DS.
RESULTS: This review article summarizes the research gaps and recommendations 
that have the potential to improve the health and quality of life for people 
with DS within the next decade.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights many of the scientific gaps that exist in DS 
research. Based on these gaps, a multidisciplinary group of DS experts has made 
recommendations to advance DS research. This paper may also aid policymakers and 
the DS community to build a comprehensive national DS research strategy.

Recognizing early cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) imaging phenotypes can help identify 
opportunities for effective treatment before irreversible myocardial pathology 
occurs. We aimed to characterize regional CS myocardial remodeling features 
correlating with future adverse cardiac events by coupling automated image 
processing and data analysis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging 
datasets. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was used to process a CMR 
database of a 10-year cohort of 117 consecutive biopsy-proven sarcoidosis 
patients. The maximum relevance - minimum redundancy method was used to select 
the best subset of all the features-24 (from manual processing) and 232 (from 
automated processing) left ventricular (LV) structural/functional features. 
Three machine learning (ML) algorithms, logistic regression (LogR), support 
vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer neural networks (MLP), were used to build 
classifiers to categorize endpoints. Over a median follow-up of 41.8 
(inter-quartile range 20.4-60.5) months, 35 sarcoidosis patients experienced a 
total of 43 cardiac events. After manual processing, LV ejection fraction 
(LVEF), late gadolinium enhancement, abnormal segmental wall motion, LV mass 
(LVM), LVMI index (LVMI), septal wall thickness, lateral wall thickness, 
relative wall thickness, and wall thickness of 9 (out of 17) individual LV 
segments were significantly different between patients with and without 
endpoints. After automated processing, LVEF, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic 
volume, LV mass and wall thickness of 92 (out of 216) individual LV segments 
were significantly different between patients with and without endpoints. To 
achieve the best predictive performance, ML algorithms selected lateral wall 
thickness, abnormal segmental wall motion, septal wall thickness, and increased 
wall thickness of 3 individual segments after manual image processing, and 
selected end-diastolic volume and 7 individual segments after automated image 
processing. LogR, SVM and MLP based on automated image processing consistently 
showed better predictive accuracies than those based on manual image processing. 
Automated image processing with a DCNN improves data resolution and regional CS 
myocardial remodeling pattern recognition, suggesting that a framework coupling 
automated image processing with data analysis can help clinical risk 
stratification.

OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess the ability of salivary 
non-coding RNA (ncRNA) levels to predict post-concussion symptoms 
lasting ≥ 21 days, and to examine the ability of ncRNAs to identify recovery 
compared to cognition and balance.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was performed on 505 saliva samples obtained 
longitudinally from 112 individuals (8-24-years-old) with mild traumatic brain 
injury (mTBI). Initial samples were obtained ≤ 14 days post-injury, and 
follow-up samples were obtained ≥ 21 days post-injury. Computerized balance and 
cognitive test performance were assessed at initial and follow-up time-points. 
Machine learning was used to define: (1) a model employing initial ncRNA levels 
to predict persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) ≥ 21 days post-injury; and 
(2) a model employing follow-up ncRNA levels to identify symptom recovery. 
Performance of the models was compared against a validated clinical prediction 
rule, and balance/cognitive test performance, respectively.
RESULTS: An algorithm using age and 16 ncRNAs predicted PPCS with greater 
accuracy than the validated clinical tool and demonstrated additive combined 
utility (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86; 95% CI 0.84-0.88). Initial balance and 
cognitive test performance did not differ between PPCS and non-PPCS groups 
(p > 0.05). Follow-up balance and cognitive test performance identified symptom 
recovery with similar accuracy to a model using 11 ncRNAs and age. A combined 
model (ncRNAs, balance, cognition) most accurately identified recovery (AUC 
0.86; 95% CI 0.83-0.89).
CONCLUSIONS: ncRNA biomarkers show promise for tracking recovery from mTBI, and 
for predicting who will have prolonged symptoms. They could provide accurate 
expectations for recovery, stratify need for intervention, and guide safe 
return-to-activities.

BACKGROUND: Tourette syndrome (TS) is often found comorbid with other 
neurodevelopmental disorders across the impulsivity-compulsivity spectrum, with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 
and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as most prevalent. This points to the 
possibility of a common etiological thread along an impulsivity-compulsivity 
continuum.
METHODS: Investigating the shared genetic basis across TS, ADHD, ASD, and OCD, 
we undertook an evaluation of cross-disorder genetic architecture and systematic 
meta-analysis, integrating summary statistics from the latest genome-wide 
association studies (93,294 individuals, 6,788,510 markers).
RESULTS: As previously identified, a common unifying factor connects TS, ADHD, 
and ASD, while TS and OCD show the highest genetic correlation in pairwise 
testing among these disorders. Thanks to a more homogeneous set of disorders and 
a targeted approach that is guided by genetic correlations, we were able to 
identify multiple novel hits and regions that seem to play a pleiotropic role 
for the specific disorders analyzed here and could not be identified through 
previous studies. In the TS-ADHD-ASD genome-wide association study single 
nucleotide polymorphism-based and gene-based meta-analysis, we uncovered 13 
genome-wide significant regions that host single nucleotide polymorphisms with a 
high posterior probability for association with all three studied disorders 
(m-value > 0.9), 11 of which were not identified in previous cross-disorder 
analysis. In contrast, we also identified two additional pleiotropic regions in 
the TS-OCD meta-analysis. Through conditional analysis, we highlighted genes and 
genetic regions that play a specific role in a TS-ADHD-ASD genetic factor versus 
TS-OCD. Cross-disorder tissue specificity analysis implicated the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis in TS-ADHD-ASD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work underlines the value of redefining the framework for 
research across traditional diagnostic categories.

Complex high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze are frequently 
produced through '-omics' profiling. Typically, these datasets contain more 
genomic features than samples, limiting the use of multivariable statistical and 
machine learning-based approaches to analysis. Therefore, effective alternative 
approaches are urgently needed to identify features-of-interest in '-omics' 
data. In this study, we present the molecular feature selection tool, a novel, 
ensemble-based, feature selection application for identifying candidate 
biomarkers in '-omics' data. As proof-of-principle, we applied the molecular 
feature selection tool to identify a small set of immune-related genes as 
potential biomarkers of three prostate adenocarcinoma subtypes. Furthermore, we 
tested the selected genes in a model to classify the three subtypes and compared 
the results to models built using all genes and all differentially expressed 
genes. Genes identified with the molecular feature selection tool performed 
better than the other models in this study in all comparison metrics: accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score using a significantly smaller set of genes. In 
addition, we developed a simple graphical user interface for the molecular 
feature selection tool, which is available for free download. This user-friendly 
interface is a valuable tool for the identification of potential biomarkers in 
gene expression datasets and is an asset for biomarker discovery studies.

PURPOSE: Developing large-scale datasets with research-quality annotations is 
challenging due to the high cost of refining clinically generated markup into 
high precision annotations. We evaluated the direct use of a large dataset with 
only clinically generated annotations in development of high-performance 
segmentation models for small research-quality challenge datasets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a large retrospective dataset from our 
institution comprised of 1,620 clinically generated segmentations, and two 
challenge datasets (PROMISE12: 50 patients, ProstateX-2: 99 patients). We 
trained a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation model using 
our entire dataset, and used that model as a template to train models on the 
challenge datasets. We also trained versions of the template model using ablated 
proportions of our dataset, and evaluated the relative benefit of those 
templates for the final models. Finally, we trained a version of the template 
model using an out-of-domain brain cancer dataset, and evaluated the relevant 
benefit of that template for the final models. We used five-fold 
cross-validation (CV) for all training and evaluation across our entire dataset.
RESULTS: Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our large dataset 
(mean overall Dice 0.916, average Hausdorff distance 0.135 across CV folds). 
Using this model as a pre-trained template for refining on two external datasets 
significantly enhanced performance (30% and 49% enhancement in Dice scores 
respectively). Mean overall Dice and mean average Hausdorff distance were 0.912 
and 0.15 for the ProstateX-2 dataset, and 0.852 and 0.581 for the PROMISE12 
dataset. Using even small quantities of data to train the template enhanced 
performance, with significant improvements using 5% or more of the data.
CONCLUSION: We trained a state-of-the-art model using unrefined clinical 
prostate annotations and found that its use as a template model significantly 
improved performance in other prostate segmentation tasks, even when trained 
with only 5% of the original dataset.

BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health concern globally. Accurately 
predicting suicidal behavior remains challenging. This study aimed to use 
machine learning approaches to examine the potential of the Swedish national 
registry data for prediction of suicidal behavior.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study sample consisted of 541,300 inpatient and 
outpatient visits by 126,205 Sweden-born patients (54% female and 46% male) aged 
18 to 39 (mean age at the visit: 27.3) years to psychiatric specialty care in 
Sweden between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. The most common 
psychiatric diagnoses at the visit were anxiety disorders (20.0%), major 
depressive disorder (16.9%), and substance use disorders (13.6%). A total of 425 
candidate predictors covering demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status 
(SES), electronic medical records, criminality, as well as family history of 
disease and crime were extracted from the Swedish registry data. The sample was 
randomly split into an 80% training set containing 433,024 visits and a 20% test 
set containing 108,276 visits. Models were trained separately for suicide 
attempt/death within 90 and 30 days following a visit using multiple machine 
learning algorithms. Model discrimination and calibration were both evaluated. 
Among all eligible visits, 3.5% (18,682) were followed by a suicide 
attempt/death within 90 days and 1.7% (9,099) within 30 days. The final models 
were based on ensemble learning that combined predictions from elastic net 
penalized logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and a neural 
network. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
(AUCs) on the test set were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.89) and 
0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90) for the outcome within 90 days and 30 days, 
respectively, both being significantly better than chance (i.e., AUC = 0.50) (p 
< 0.01). Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were reported at 
different risk thresholds. A limitation of our study is that our models have not 
yet been externally validated, and thus, the generalizability of the models to 
other populations remains unknown.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining the ensemble method of multiple machine learning 
algorithms and high-quality data solely from the Swedish registers, we developed 
prognostic models to predict short-term suicide attempt/death with good 
discrimination and calibration. Whether novel predictors can improve predictive 
performance requires further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) improves outcomes in patients with LVO 
but many still experience mortality or severe disability. We sought to develop 
machine learning (ML) models that predict 90-day outcomes after MT for LVO.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent MT for LVO between 2015-2021 at a 
Comprehensive Stroke Center were reviewed. Outcomes included 90-day favorable 
functional status (mRS 0-2), severe disability (mRS 4-6), and mortality. ML 
models were trained for each outcome using prethrombectomy data (pre) and with 
thrombectomy data (post).
RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty seven patients met the inclusion criteria. 
After model screening and hyperparameter tuning the top performing ML model for 
each outcome and timepoint was random forest (RF). Using only prethrombectomy 
features, the AUCs for the RFpre models were 0.73 (95% CI 0.62-0.85) for 
favorable functional status, 0.77 (95% CI 0.65-0.86) for severe disability, and 
0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.88) for mortality. All of these were better than a standard 
statistical model except for favorable functional status. Each RF model 
outperformed Pre, SPAN-100, THRIVE, and HIAT scores (P < 0.0001 for all). The 
most predictive features were premorbid mRS, age, and NIHSS. Incorporating MT 
data, the AUCs for the RFpost models were 0.80 (95% CI 0.67-0.90) for favorable 
functional status, 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.91) for severe disability, and 0.71 (95% 
CI 0.55-0.84) for mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: RF models accurately predicted 90-day outcomes after MT and 
performed better than standard statistical and clinical prediction models.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment using peripheral blood instead of bone 
marrow aspirate/biopsy specimen or the biopsy of the cancerous infiltrated by 
lymphoid malignancies is an emerging technique with enormous interest of 
research and technological innovation at the current time. In some lymphoid 
malignancies (particularly ALL), Studies have shown that MRD monitoring of the 
peripheral blood may be an adequate alternative to frequent BM aspirations. 
However, additional studies investigating the biology of liquid biopsies in ALL 
and its potential as an MRD marker in larger patient cohorts in treatment 
protocols are warranted. Despite the promising data, there are still limitations 
in liquid biopsies in lymphoid malignancies, such as standardization of the 
sample collection and processing, determination of timing and duration for 
liquid biopsy analysis, and definition of the biological characteristics and 
specificity of the techniques evaluated such as flow cytometry, molecular 
techniques, and next generation sequencies. The use of liquid biopsy for 
detection of minimal residual disease in T-cell lymphoma is still experimental 
but it has made significant progress in multiple myeloma for example. Recent 
attempt to use artificial intelligence may help simplify the algorithm for 
testing and may help avoid inter-observer variation and operator dependency in 
these highly technically demanding testing process.

Advances in robotic technology have improved standard techniques in numerous 
surgical and endovascular specialties, offering more precision, control, and 
better patient outcomes. Robotic-assisted interventional neuroradiology is an 
emerging field at the intersection of interventional neuroradiology and 
biomedical robotics. Endovascular robotics can automate maneuvers to reduce 
procedure times and increase its safety, reduce occupational hazards associated 
with ionizing radiations, and expand networks of care to reduce gaps in 
geographic access to neurointerventions. To date, many robotic 
neurointerventional procedures have been successfully performed, including 
cerebral angiography, intracranial aneurysm embolization, carotid stenting, and 
epistaxis embolization. This review aims to provide a survey of the state of the 
art in robotic-assisted interventional neuroradiology, consider their technical 
and adoption limitations, and explore future developments critical for the 
widespread adoption of robotic-assisted neurointerventions.

In this review, we provide a description of those candidate biomarkers which 
have been demonstrated by multiple-omics approaches to vary in correlation with 
specific clinical manifestations of sickle cell severity. We believe that future 
clinical analyses of severity phenotype will require a multiomic analysis, or an 
omics stack approach, which includes integrated interactomics. It will also 
require the analysis of big data sets. These candidate biomarkers, whether they 
are individual or panels of functionally linked markers, will require future 
validation in large prospective and retrospective clinical studies. Once 
validated, the hope is that informative biomarkers will be used for the 
identification of individuals most likely to experience severe complications, 
and thereby be applied for the design of patient-specific therapeutic approaches 
and response to treatment. This would be the beginning of precision medicine for 
sickle cell disease.

Background: The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relies on behavioral 
assessment. Efforts to define biomarkers of ASD have not resulted in an 
objective, reliable test. Studies of RNA levels in ASD have demonstrated 
potential utility, but have been limited by a focus on single RNA types, small 
sample sizes, and lack of developmental delay controls. We hypothesized that a 
saliva-based poly-"omic" RNA panel could objectively distinguish children with 
ASD from their neurotypical peers and children with non-ASD developmental delay. 
Methods: This multi-center cross-sectional study included 456 children, ages 
19-83 months. Children were either neurotypical (n = 134) or had a diagnosis of 
ASD (n = 238), or non-ASD developmental delay (n = 84). Comprehensive human and 
microbial RNA abundance was measured in the saliva of all participants using 
unbiased next generation sequencing. Prior to analysis, the sample was randomly 
divided into a training set (82% of subjects) and an independent validation test 
set (18% of subjects). The training set was used to develop an RNA-based 
algorithm that distinguished ASD and non-ASD children. The validation set was 
not used in model development (feature selection or training) but served only to 
validate empirical accuracy. Results: In the training set (n = 372; mean age 51 
months; 75% male; 51% ASD), a set of 32 RNA features (controlled for demographic 
and medical characteristics), identified ASD status with a cross-validated area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.88). In the completely separate 
validation test set (n = 84; mean age 50 months; 85% male; 60% ASD), the 
algorithm maintained an AUC of 0.88 (82% sensitivity and 88% specificity). 
Notably, the RNA features were implicated in physiologic processes related to 
ASD (axon guidance, neurotrophic signaling). Conclusion: Salivary poly-omic RNA 
measurement represents a novel, non-invasive approach that can accurately 
identify children with ASD. This technology could improve the specificity of 
referrals for ASD evaluation or provide objective support for ASD diagnoses.

Literature suggests that anxiety affects gait and balance among young adults. 
However, previous studies using machine learning (ML) have only used gait to 
identify individuals who report feeling anxious. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study was to identify individuals who report feeling anxious at that time using 
a combination of gait and quiet balance ML. Using a cross-sectional design, 
participants (n = 88) completed the Profile of Mood Survey-Short Form (POMS-SF) 
to measure current feelings of anxiety and were then asked to complete a 
modified Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) and a 
two-minute walk around a 6 m track while wearing nine APDM mobility sensors. 
Results from our study finds that Random Forest classifiers had the highest 
median accuracy rate (75%) and the five top features for identifying anxious 
individuals were all gait parameters (turn angles, variance in neck, lumbar 
rotation, lumbar movement in the sagittal plane, and arm movement). Post-hoc 
analyses suggest that individuals who reported feeling anxious also walked using 
gait patterns most similar to older individuals who are fearful of falling. 
Additionally, we find that individuals who are anxious also had less postural 
stability when they had visual input; however, these individuals had less 
movement during postural sway when visual input was removed.

Data on incidence, prevalence and burden of ADHD are crucial for clinicians, 
patients, and stakeholders. We present the incidence, prevalence, and burden of 
ADHD globally and across countries from 1990 to 2019 from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study. We also: (1) calculated the ADHD prevalence based on data 
actually collected as opposed to the prevalence estimated by the GBD with data 
imputation for countries without prevalence data; (2) discussed the GBD 
estimated ADHD burden in the light of recent meta-analytic evidence on 
ADHD-related mortality. In 2019, GBD estimated global age-standardized incidence 
and prevalence of ADHD across the lifespan at 0.061% (95%UI = 0.040-0.087) and 
1.13% (95%UI = 0.831-1.494), respectively. ADHD accounted for 0.8% of the global 
mental disorder DALYs, with mortality set at zero by the GBD. From 1990 to 2019 
there was a decrease of -8.75% in the global age-standardized prevalence and of 
-4.77% in the global age-standardized incidence. The largest increase in 
incidence, prevalence, and burden from 1990 to 2019 was observed in the USA; the 
largest decrease occurred in Finland. Incidence, prevalence, and DALYs remained 
approximately 2.5 times higher in males than females from 1990 to 2019. 
Incidence peaked at age 5-9 years, and prevalence and DALYs at age 10-14 years. 
Our re-analysis of data prior to 2013 showed a prevalence in 
children/adolescents two-fold higher (5.41%, 95% CI: 4.67-6.15%) compared to the 
corresponding GBD estimated prevalence (2.68%, 1.83-3.72%), with no significant 
differences between low- and middle- and high-income countries. We also found 
meta-analytic evidence of significantly increased ADHD-related mortality due to 
unnatural causes. While it provides the most detailed evidence on temporal 
trends, as well as on geographic and sex variations in incidence, prevalence, 
and burden of ADHD, the GBD may have underestimated the ADHD prevalence and 
burden. Given the influence of the GBD on research and policies, methodological 
issues should be addressed in its future editions.

How predictable are life trajectories? We investigated this question with a 
scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built 
predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and 
Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich 
dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best 
predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from 
a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly 
associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the 
technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest 
practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and 
illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.

IMPORTANCE: An objective, reliable indicator of the presence and severity of 
concussive brain injury and of the readiness for the return to activity has the 
potential to reduce concussion-related disability.
OBJECTIVE: To validate the classification accuracy of a previously derived, 
machine learning, multimodal, brain electrical activity-based Concussion Index 
in an independent cohort of athletes with concussion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective diagnostic cohort study was 
conducted at 10 clinical sites (ie, US universities and high schools) between 
February 4, 2017, and March 20, 2019. A cohort comprising a consecutive sample 
of 207 athletes aged 13 to 25 years with concussion and 373 matched athlete 
controls without concussion were assessed with electroencephalography, cognitive 
testing, and symptom inventories within 72 hours of injury, at return to play, 
and 45 days after return to play. Variables from the multimodal assessment were 
used to generate a Concussion Index at each time point. Athletes with concussion 
had experienced a witnessed head impact, were removed from play for 5 days or 
more, and had an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15. Participants were 
excluded for known neurologic disease or history within the last year of 
traumatic brain injury. Athlete controls were matched to athletes with 
concussion for age, sex, and type of sport played.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Classification accuracy of the Concussion Index at 
time of injury using a prespecified cutoff of 70 or less (total range, 0-100, 
where ≤70 indicates it is likely the individual has a concussion and >70 
indicates it is likely the individual does not have a concussion).
RESULTS: Of 580 eligible participants with analyzable data, 207 had concussion 
(124 male participants [59.9%]; mean [SD] age, 19.4 [2.5] years), and 373 were 
athlete controls (187 male participants [50.1%]; mean [SD] age, 19.6 [2.2] 
years). The Concussion Index had a sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 80.5%-90.4%), 
specificity of 70.8% (95% CI, 65.9%-75.4%), negative predictive value of 90.1% 
(95% CI, 86.1%-93.3%), positive predictive value of 62.0% (95% CI, 56.1%-67.7%), 
and area under receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.89. At day 0, the 
mean (SD) Concussion Index among athletes with concussion was significantly 
lower than among athletes without concussion (75.0 [14.0] vs 32.7 [27.2]; 
P < .001). Among athletes with concussion, there was a significant increase in 
the Concussion Index between day 0 and return to play, with a mean (SD) paired 
difference between these time points of -41.2 (27.0) (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that the multimodal brain 
activity-based Concussion Index has high classification accuracy for 
identification of the likelihood of concussion at time of injury and may be 
associated with the return to control values at the time of recovery. The 
Concussion Index has the potential to aid in the clinical diagnosis of 
concussion and in the assessment of athletes' readiness to return to play.

Following the outbreak and subsequent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), clinical diagnostic laboratories worldwide sought accurate and 
reliable testing methodologies. However, many laboratories were and still are 
hindered by a number of factors, including an unprecedented demand for testing, 
reagent and laboratory supply shortages and availability of qualified staff. To 
respond to these concerns, two separate laboratory-developed tests were 
validated for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) using two different specimen types. In addition, these assays 
target different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2, allowing for viral detection and 
mitigating genetic variation. Lower limit of detection and clinical evaluation 
studies showed detection of SARS-CoV-2 at 500 cp/mL with nasopharyngeal and 
saliva samples. These multiplexed RT-qPCR assays, although based on modified 
CDC, New York State Department of Health, and World Health Organization 
Emergency Use Authorization tests, allow for higher throughput and rapid 
turnaround time, benefiting patients, clinicians, and communities as a whole. 
These cost-effective tests also use readily obtainable reagents, circumventing 
commercial assay supply chain issues. The laboratory-developed tests described 
here have improved patient care and are highly adaptable should the need arise 
at other clinical diagnostic laboratories. Furthermore, the foundation and 
design of these assays may be modified in the future for detection of COVID-19 
variants or other RNA-based viral detection tests.

Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are one of main 
predictors to estimate ground-level particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) 
concentrations. Since AOD products, however, are only provided under 
high-quality conditions, missing values usually exist in areas such as clouds, 
cloud shadows, and bright surfaces. In this study, spatially continuous AOD and 
subsequent PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated over East Asia using 
satellite- and model-based data and auxiliary data in a Random Forest (RF) 
approach. Data collected from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI; 8 
times per day) in 2016 were used to develop AOD and PM models. Three schemes 
(i.e. G1, A1, and A2) were proposed for AOD modeling according to target AOD 
data (GOCI AOD and AERONET AOD) and the existence of satellite-derived AOD. The 
A2 scheme showed the best performance (validation R2 of 0.74 and prediction R2 
of 0.73 when GOCI AOD did not exist) and the resultant AOD was used to estimate 
spatially continuous PM concentrations. The PM models with location information 
produced successful estimation results with R2 of 0.88 and 0.90, and rRMSE of 
26.9 and 27.2% for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The spatial distribution maps 
of PM well captured the seasonal and spatial characteristics of PM reported in 
the literature, which implies the proposed approaches can be adopted for an 
operational estimation of spatially continuous AOD and PMs under all sky 
conditions.

This study focused on the development and initial psychometric evaluation of a 
set of online, webcam-collected, and artificial intelligence-derived patient 
performance measures for neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes (NDGS). Initial 
testing and qualitative input was used to develop four stimulus paradigms 
capturing social and cognitive processes, including social attention, receptive 
vocabulary, processing speed, and single-word reading. The paradigms were 
administered to a sample of 375 participants, including 163 with NDGS, 56 with 
idiopathic neurodevelopmental disability (NDD), and 156 neurotypical controls. 
Twelve measures were created from the four stimulus paradigms. Valid completion 
rates varied from 87 to 100% across measures, with lower but adequate completion 
rates in participants with intellectual disability. Adequate to excellent 
internal consistency reliability (α = 0.67 to 0.95) was observed across 
measures. Test-retest reproducibility at 1-month follow-up and stability at 
4-month follow-up was fair to good (r = 0.40-0.73) for 8 of the 12 measures. All 
gaze-based measures showed evidence of convergent and discriminant validity with 
parent-report measures of other cognitive and behavioral constructs. Comparisons 
across NDGS groups revealed distinct patterns of social and cognitive 
functioning, including people with PTEN mutations showing a less impaired 
overall pattern and people with SYNGAP1 mutations showing more attentional, 
processing speed, and social processing difficulties relative to people with 
NFIX mutations. Webcam-collected performance measures appear to be a reliable 
and potentially useful method for objective characterization and monitoring of 
social and cognitive processes in NDGS and idiopathic NDD. Additional validation 
work, including more detailed convergent and discriminant validity analyses and 
examination of sensitivity to change, is needed to replicate and extend these 
observations.

CONTEXT: Hereditary cases account for about 5% of all cases of renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC). With advances in next-generation sequencing, several new 
hereditary syndromes have been described in the last few years.
OBJECTIVE: To review and summarise the recent preclinical and clinical 
literature in hereditary renal cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the literature was performed in 
November 2018 using PubMed and OMIM databases, with an emphasis on kidney 
cancer, genetics and genomics, clinical criteria, and management.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Several autosomal dominant hereditary RCC syndromes have 
been described, including those related to germline pathogenic variants in VHL, 
MET, FH, TSC1/TSC2, FLCN, SDHA/B/C/D, BAP1, CDC73, and MITF. Clinical spectrum 
of SDH, BAP1, and MITF is still being defined, although these appear to be 
associated with a lower incidence of RCC. FH and likely BAP1 RCC are associated 
with more aggressive disease. Preclinical and clinical studies show that using 
systemic therapy that exploits specific genetic pathways is a promising 
strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: There are several well-described hereditary RCC syndromes, as well 
as recently identified ones, for which the full clinical spectrum is yet to be 
defined. In the new era of precision medicine, identification of these syndromes 
may play an important role in management and systemic treatment selection.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This review covers updates in the diagnosis and management of

BACKGROUND: Wearable technologies play an important role in measuring physical 
activity (PA) and promoting health. Standardized validation indices (i.e., 
accuracy, bias, and precision) compare performance of step counting wearable 
technologies in young people.
PURPOSE: To produce a catalog of validity indices for step counting wearable 
technologies assessed during different treadmill speeds (slow [0.8-3.2 km/h], 
normal [4.0-6.4 km/h], fast [7.2-8.0 km/h]), wear locations (waist, wrist/arm, 
thigh, and ankle), and age groups (children, 6-12 years; adolescents, 
13-17 years; young adults, 18-20 years).
METHODS: One hundred seventeen individuals (13.1 ± 4.2 years, 50.4% female) 
participated in this cross-sectional study and completed 5-min treadmill bouts 
(0.8 km/h to 8.0 km/h) while wearing eight devices (Waist: Actical, ActiGraph 
GT3X+, NL-1000, SW-200; Wrist: ActiGraph GT3X+; Arm: SenseWear; Thigh: activPAL; 
Ankle: StepWatch). Directly observed steps served as the criterion measure. 
Accuracy (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE), bias (mean percentage error, 
MPE), and precision (correlation coefficient, r; standard deviation, SD; 
coefficient of variation, CoV) were computed.
RESULTS: Five of the eight tested wearable technologies (i.e., Actical, 
waist-worn ActiGraph GT3X+, activPAL, StepWatch, and SW-200) performed at < 5% 
MAPE over the range of normal speeds. More generally, waist (MAPE = 4%), thigh 
(4%) and ankle (5%) locations displayed higher accuracy than the wrist location 
(23%) at normal speeds. On average, all wearable technologies displayed the 
lowest accuracy across slow speeds (MAPE = 50.1 ± 35.5%), and the highest 
accuracy across normal speeds (MAPE = 15.9 ± 21.7%). Speed and wear location had 
a significant effect on accuracy and bias (P < 0.001), but not on precision 
(P > 0.05). Age did not have any effect (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Standardized validation indices focused on accuracy, bias, and 
precision were cataloged by speed, wear location, and age group to serve as 
important reference points when selecting and/or evaluating device performance 
in young people moving forward. Reduced performance can be expected at very slow 
walking speeds (0.8 to 3.2 km/h) for all devices. Ankle-worn and thigh-worn 
devices demonstrated the highest accuracy. Speed and wear location had a 
significant effect on accuracy and bias, but not precision.

Anti-PD-1 therapy is a novel immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy with 
tremendous potential in treating refractory/relapsed cancers. The 20year journey 
of human PD-1 research went through 3 phases: 1) discovering PD-1 gene structure 
and genomic organization, 2) understanding the mechanism of PD-1 mediated 
immune-checkpoint regulatory effects in coordination with its ligands (PD-L1 and 
L2), 3) and translating our knowledge of PD-1 gene into a robust clinical 
anticancer approach by targeting the PD-1 immune-checkpoint pathway. The success 
of human PD-1 gene study reflects the advancement and trends of modern 
biomedical research from the laboratory to the bedside. However, our journey of 
understanding the PD-1 gene is not yet complete. Clinical investigation data 
show a high variety of response rates among different types of cancers to PD-1 
immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy, with a range of 18% to 87%. There is no 
reliable biomarker to predict an individual patient's response to PD-1 
inhibitory immunotherapy. Patients can present with primary, adaptive, or even 
acquired resistance to PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy. Furthermore, 
the emerging data demonstrates that certain patients experience hyperprogressive 
disease status after receiving PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy. In 
conclusion, PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy has opened up a new venue 
of advanced cancer immunotherapy. Meanwhile, further efforts are still warranted 
in both basic scientific mechanism studies and clinical investigation using the 
principles of personalized and precision medicine.

von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is associated with significant morbidity because of 
excessive bleeding. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent and 
treat these symptoms. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of any von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) activity assay in the diagnosis and classification of 
patients for VWD. We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for eligible 
studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of 
Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 and the certainty of evidence using the 
GRADE framework. We pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review 
included 77 studies that evaluated the use of newer tests of VWF platelet 
binding activity (VWF:GPIbR, VWF:GPIbM) and VWF:RCo for the diagnosis of VWD (13 
studies), VWF propeptide to VWF:Ag ratio, and desmopressin trial for the 
diagnosis of type 1C VWD (5 studies), VWF multimer analysis and VWF:CB/VWF:Ag 
ratio for the classification of type 2 VWD (11 studies), genetic testing and 
ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation to diagnose type 2B VWD (14 studies), 
genetic testing and FVIII:VWF binding to diagnose type 2N VWD (17 studies). 
Based on available diagnostic test accuracy, there appear to be comparable test 
accuracy results between newer tests of platelet binding activity of VWF 
function and VWF:RCo. The findings of these reviews support VWF multimer 
analysis or VWF:CB/VWF:Ag to diagnose type 2 VWD. The desmopressin trial test 
with 1- and 4-hour postinfusion blood work is the test of choice to confirm 
increased VWF clearance in patients with suspected VWD type 1C. Additionally, 
genetic testing is most useful in diagnosing type 2B VWD and has a role in the 
diagnostic algorithm of suspected type 2N VWD.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is associated with adverse outcomes 
in prostate cancer and has clinical potential as a prognostic biomarker. The 
objective of this work was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for 
automated detection and localization of PTEN loss on immunohistochemically (IHC) 
stained sections. PTEN loss was assessed using IHC in two prostate tissue 
microarrays (TMA) (internal cohort, n = 272 and external cohort, n = 129 
patients). TMA cores were visually scored for PTEN loss by pathologists and, if 
present, spatially annotated. Cores from each patient within the internal TMA 
cohort were split into 90% cross-validation (N = 2048) and 10% hold-out testing 
(N = 224) sets. ResNet-101 architecture was used to train core-based 
classification using a multi-resolution ensemble approach (×5, ×10, and ×20). 
For spatial annotations, single resolution pixel-based classification was 
trained from patches extracted at ×20 resolution, interpolated to ×40 
resolution, and applied in a sliding-window fashion. A final AI-based prediction 
model was created from combining multi-resolution and pixel-based models. 
Performance was evaluated in 428 cores of external cohort. From both cohorts, a 
total of 2700 cores were studied, with a frequency of PTEN loss of 14.5% in 
internal (180/1239) and external 13.5% (43/319) cancer cores. The final AI-based 
prediction of PTEN status demonstrated 98.1% accuracy (95.0% sensitivity, 98.4% 
specificity; median dice score = 0.811) in internal cohort cross-validation set 
and 99.1% accuracy (100% sensitivity, 99.0% specificity; median dice 
score = 0.804) in internal cohort test set. Overall core-based classification in 
the external cohort was significantly improved in the external cohort (area 
under the curve = 0.964, 90.6% sensitivity, 95.7% specificity) when further 
trained (fine-tuned) using 15% of cohort data (19/124 patients). These results 
demonstrate a robust and fully automated method for detection and localization 
of PTEN loss in prostate cancer tissue samples. AI-based algorithms have 
potential to streamline sample assessment in research and clinical laboratories.

Many species have experienced dramatic changes in both geographic range and 
population sizes in recent history. Increases in the geographic range or 
population size of disease vectors have public health relevance as these 
increases often precipitate the emergence of infectious diseases in human 
populations. Accurately identifying environmental factors affecting the 
biogeographic patterns of vector species is a long-standing analytical 
challenge, stemming from a paucity of data capturing periods of rapid changes in 
vector demographics. We systematically investigated the occurrence and abundance 
of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks at 532 sampling locations throughout New York 
State (NY), USA, between 2008 and 2018, a time frame that encompasses the 
emergence of diseases vectored by these ticks. Analyses of these field-collected 
data demonstrated a range expansion into northern and western NY during the last 
decade. Nymphal abundances increased in newly colonised areas, while remaining 
stable in areas with long-standing populations over the last decade. These 
trends in the geographic range and abundance of nymphs correspond to both the 
geographic expansion of human Lyme disease cases and increases in incidence 
rates. Analytic models fitted to these data incorporating time, space, and 
environmental factors, accurately identified drivers of the observed changes in 
nymphal occurrence and abundance. These models accounted for the spatial and 
temporal variation in the occurrence and abundance of nymphs and can accurately 
predict nymphal population patterns in future years. Forecasting disease risk at 
fine spatial scales prior to the transmission season can influence both public 
health mitigation strategies and individual behaviours, potentially impacting 
tick-borne disease risk and subsequently human disease incidence.

Automatic and accurate prostate ultrasound segmentation is a long-standing and 
challenging problem due to the severe noise and ambiguous/missing prostate 
boundaries. In this work, we propose a novel polar transform network (PTN) to 
handle this problem from a fundamentally new perspective, where the prostate is 
represented and segmented in the polar coordinate space rather than the original 
image grid space. This new representation gives a prostate volume, especially 
the most challenging apex and base sub-areas, much denser samples than the 
background and thus facilitate the learning of discriminative features for 
accurate prostate segmentation. Moreover, in the polar representation, the 
prostate surface can be efficiently parameterized using a 2D surface radius map 
with respect to a centroid coordinate, which allows the proposed PTN to obtain 
superior accuracy compared with its counterparts using convolutional neural 
networks while having significantly fewer (18%∼41%) trainable parameters. We 
also equip our PTN with a novel strategy of centroid perturbed test-time 
augmentation (CPTTA), which is designed to further improve the segmentation 
accuracy and quantitatively assess the model uncertainty at the same time. The 
uncertainty estimation function provides valuable feedback to clinicians when 
manual modifications or approvals are required for the segmentation, 
substantially improving the clinical significance of our work. We conduct a 
three-fold cross validation on a clinical dataset consisting of 315 transrectal 
ultrasound (TRUS) images to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the 
proposed method. The experimental results show that our proposed PTN with CPTTA 
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance on most 
of the metrics while exhibiting a much smaller model size. Source code of the 
proposed PTN is released at https://github.com/DIAL-RPI/PTN.

BCORL1 is a transcriptional corepressor homologous to BCOR. We describe 12 
BCORL1-altered uterine sarcomas with striking resemblance to BCOR-altered 
endometrial stromal sarcoma (BCOR-ESS), including 5 with BCORL1 rearrangements 
(JAZF1-BCORL1, EP300-BCORL1, or internal BCORL1 rearrangement), 5 with 
inactivating BCORL1 mutations (T513fs*22, P600fs*1, R945*, R1196*, or R1265fs*4) 
and 2 with homozygous BCORL1 deletion. The median patient age was 57.5 years 
(range 33-79). An association with aggressive clinical behavior was identified. 
Diagnoses assigned prior to genomic testing varied: 7 tumors were previously 
diagnosed as ESS, 2 as high-grade uterine sarcomas, 2 as myxoid uterine 
leiomyosarcomas, and 1 as a uterine spindle cell neoplasm consistent with 
leiomyosarcoma. Tumors harbored frequent gelatinous, mucomyxoid-like appearance 
by gross examination and unique histology with morphological overlap with 
BCOR-ESS. Key microscopic features included (1) a spindle cell appearance, most 
often with at least focal myxoid stroma, (2) variable amounts of hypocellular 
fibromyxoid spindle areas with lower grade atypia and/or (3) variable amounts of 
epithelioid areas with higher grade atypia. Specifically, spindle and 
epithelioid components were present in 100 and 75% of sarcomas, respectively; 
myxoid stroma was identified in 83%, collagen plaques or fibrosis in 50%, and 
high-grade nuclear atypia was present in 42%. Like BCOR-ESS, 50% of 
BCORL1-altered sarcomas exhibited CDK4 amplification or CDKN2A loss. In 
contrast, 33% harbored NF1 alterations, while 25% had other alterations in the 
NF2-mTOR pathway, expanding potential therapeutic targets. In conclusion, 
inactivating BCORL1 genomic alterations may define a distinct subset of 
high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas with biological overlap with BCOR-ESS, 
both of which may mimic myxoid leiomyosarcomas.

PURPOSE: To develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model for identifying 
patients with lymph node (LN) metastasis based on digital evaluation of primary 
tumors and train the model using cystectomy specimens available from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project; patients from our institution were included for 
validation of the leave-out test cohort.
METHODS: In all, 307 patients were identified for inclusion in the study (TCGA, 
n = 294; in-house, n = 13). Deep learning models were trained from image patches 
at 2.5×, 5×, 10×, and 20× magnifications, and spatially resolved prediction maps 
were combined with microenvironment (lymphocyte infiltration) features to derive 
a final patient-level AI score (probability of LN metastasis). Training and 
validation included 219 patients (training, n = 146; validation, n = 73); 89 
patients (TCGA, n = 75; in-house, n = 13) were reserved as an independent 
testing set. Multivariable logistic regression models for predicting LN status 
based on clinicopathologic features alone and a combined model with AI score 
were fit to training and validation sets.
RESULTS: Several patients were determined to have positive LN metastasis in TCGA 
(n = 105; 35.7%) and in-house (n = 3; 23.1%) cohorts. A clinicopathologic model 
that considered using factors such as age, T stage, and lymphovascular invasion 
demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.755 (95% CI, 0.680 to 0.831) in 
the training and validation cohorts compared with the cross validation of the AI 
score (likelihood of positive LNs), which achieved an AUC of 0.866 (95% CI, 
0.812 to 0.920; P = .021). Performance in the test cohort was similar, with a 
clinicopathologic model AUC of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.554 to 0.802) and an AI score of 
0.784 (95% CI, 0.702 to 0.896; P = .21). In addition, the AI score remained 
significant after adjusting for clinicopathologic variables (P = 1.08 × 10-9), 
and the combined model significantly outperformed clinicopathologic features 
alone in the test cohort with an AUC of 0.807 (95% CI, 0.702 to 0.912; P = 
.047).
CONCLUSION: Patients who are at higher risk of having positive LNs during 
cystectomy can be identified on primary tumor samples using novel AI-based 
methodologies applied to digital hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides.

Positive program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an 
approved companion diagnostic guiding the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in 
uterine cervical carcinoma (CXC). The clinical and genomic features of 
PD-L1-positive (PD-L1positive) CXC have not been previously described. We 
reviewed the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 647 CXC cases that were 
tested using DAKO 22C3 PD-L1 IHC and comprehensive genomic profiling during the 
course of clinical care. PD-L1positive cases were defined via a combined 
positive score of ≥ 1. No differences were found in age, genetic ancestry, and 
HPV status of the PD-L1positive (n = 548) and PD-L1negative disease subset. The 
PD-L1 positivity rate varied by histologic subtype of CXC with squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) having a PD-L1 positivity rate of 91% (397/437) and usual-type 
adenocarcinoma's PD-L1 positivity rate being 60% (35/58). In addition, the PD-L1 
positivity rate varied depending on site of the specimen with 89.1% (261/293) 
positivity rate observed in cervix specimens compared to 25% (2/8) in brain 
metastases specimens. No significant difference in tumor mutational burden 
(TMB), microsatellite instability, and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) amplification was 
observed between PD-L1positive and PD-L1negative CXC subsets. By combining TMB 
with PD-L1, an additional 17 patients are eligible for pembrolizumab when 
compared to PD-L1 testing alone. TERT promoter alterations and APOBEC mutational 
signature were enriched in the PD-L1positive CXC SCC (p = 0.011, and p = 0.004, 
respectively). Our study reveals important prevalence data on PD-L1 positivity 
in CXC non-SCC and suggests that further studies in these histologic subtypes 
are warranted. In addition, we also provide a key framework to guide both 
specimen selection and future investigations of predictors of immunotherapy 
response in cervical cancer patients. Lastly, TERT promoter alterations and 
APOBEC mutational signature may be a biologically unique subset of PD-L1positive 
CXC SCC.

INTRODUCTION: Vaccine hesitancy is a global health threat undermining control of 
many vaccine-preventable diseases. Patient-level education has largely been 
ineffective in reducing vaccine concerns and increasing vaccine uptake. We built 
and evaluated a personalized vaccine risk communication website called 
LetsTalkShots in English, Spanish and French (Canadian) for vaccines across the 
lifespan. LetsTalkShots tailors lived experiences, credible sources and 
informational animations to disseminate the right message from the right 
messenger to the right person, applying a broad range of behavioral theories.
METHODS: We used mixed-methods research to test our animation and some aspects 
of credible sources and personal narratives. We conducted 67 discussion groups 
(n = 325 persons), stratified by race/ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, and 
White people) and population (e.g., parents, pregnant women, adolescents, 
younger adults, and older adults). Using a large Ipsos survey among 
English-speaking respondents (n = 2,272), we tested animations aligned with 
vaccine concerns and specific to population (e.g., parents of children, parents 
of adolescents, younger adults, older adults).
RESULTS: Discussion groups provided robust feedback specific to each animation 
as well as areas for improvements across animations. Most respondents indicated 
that the information presented was interesting (85.5%), clear (96.0%), helpful 
(87.0%), and trustworthy (82.2%).
DISCUSSION: Tailored vaccine risk communication can assist decision makers as 
they consider vaccination for themselves, their families, and their communities. 
LetsTalkShots presents a model for personalized communication in other areas of 
medicine and public health.

BACKGROUND: Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are arboviruses of major global health 
concern. Decisions regarding the clinical management of suspected arboviral 
infection are challenging in resource-limited settings, particularly when 
deciding on patient hospitalization. The objective of this study was to 
determine if hospitalization of individuals with suspected arboviral infections 
could be predicted using subject intake data.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two prediction models were developed using data 
from a surveillance study in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador with a 
high burden of arboviral infections. Data were obtained from subjects who 
presented at sentinel medical centers with suspected arboviral infection 
(November 2013 to September 2017). The first prediction model-called the 
Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA)-used only demographic and symptom 
data. The second prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected 
Arbovirus with Laboratory (SISAL)-incorporated laboratory data. These models 
were selected by comparing the prediction ability of seven machine learning 
algorithms; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the 
prediction of a test dataset was used to select the final algorithm for each 
model. After eliminating those with missing data, the SISA dataset had 534 
subjects, and the SISAL dataset had 98 subjects. For SISA, the best prediction 
algorithm was the generalized boosting model, with an AUC of 0.91. For SISAL, 
the best prediction algorithm was the elastic net with an AUC of 0.94. A 
sensitivity analysis revealed that SISA and SISAL are not directly comparable to 
one another.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both SISA and SISAL were able to predict arbovirus 
hospitalization with a high degree of accuracy in our dataset. These algorithms 
will need to be tested and validated on new data from future patients. Machine 
learning is a powerful prediction tool and provides an excellent option for new 
management tools and clinical assessment of arboviral infection.

A strong motivation for undertaking psychiatric gene discovery studies is to 
provide novel insights into unknown biology. Although attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is highly heritable, and large, rare copy number 
variants (CNVs) contribute to risk, little is known about its pathogenesis and 
it remains commonly misunderstood. We assembled and pooled five ADHD and control 
CNV data sets from the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States of America, 
Northern Europe and Canada. Our aim was to test for enrichment of 
neurodevelopmental gene sets, implicated by recent exome-sequencing studies of 
(a) schizophrenia and (b) autism as a means of testing the hypothesis that 
common pathogenic mechanisms underlie ADHD and these other neurodevelopmental 
disorders. We also undertook hypothesis-free testing of all biological pathways. 
We observed significant enrichment of individual genes previously found to 
harbour schizophrenia de novo non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs; 
P=5.4 × 10(-4)) and targets of the Fragile X mental retardation protein 
(P=0.0018). No enrichment was observed for activity-regulated 
cytoskeleton-associated protein (P=0.23) or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
(P=0.74) post-synaptic signalling gene sets previously implicated in 
schizophrenia. Enrichment of ADHD CNV hits for genes impacted by autism de novo 
SNVs (P=0.019 for non-synonymous SNV genes) did not survive Bonferroni 
correction. Hypothesis-free testing yielded several highly significantly 
enriched biological pathways, including ion channel pathways. Enrichment 
findings were robust to multiple testing corrections and to sensitivity analyses 
that excluded the most significant sample. The findings reveal that CNVs in ADHD 
converge on biologically meaningful gene clusters, including ones now 
established as conferring risk of other neurodevelopmental disorders.

OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
radiographic fit/fill measurements and biomechanical performance of three canine 
cementless total hip implant designs using an in vitro biomechanical testing 
protocol that replicates compression and torsion.
STUDY DESIGN:  Eighteen (six/group) canine cadaveric femurs were implanted with 
one of three cementless total hip implant designs: (1) collarless, (2) collared 
or (3) lateral bolt stems. Femoral length, canal flare index (CFI), canal fill, 
stem fit, stem level and stem angle were measured as independent variables. 
Biomechanical performance was tested using physiological, non-destructive gait 
loading (loading protocols) and destructive testing (failure protocols).
RESULTS:  During loading protocols, compressive stiffness was influenced by stem 
level (p < 0.05) and torsional stiffness was influenced by stem level and CFI 
for collarless stems (p < 0.05). During failure protocols, peak load was 
influenced by mediolateral (ML) stem angle (p < 0.05) and CFI (p < 0.01) for 
collarless stems and CFI for lateral bolt stems (p < 0.05). Peak torque was 
influenced by ML stem angle, craniocaudal stem angle and CFI for collarless 
stems (p < 0.05) and average ML fill for collared stems (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION:  Biomechanical performance of collarless stems in cementless hip 
arthroplasty is more impacted by radiographic fit/fill than lateral bolt and 
collared stems. As a result, collarless stems may be more dependent on 
preoperative fit and intraoperative precision.

BACKGROUND: For patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) and chemotherapy (chemo) ICPI represent two 
distinct first-line standard-of-care regimens without clear and established 
biomarkers to inform the optimal choice for individual patients. Here, we 
examined the complementary roles of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and programmed 
death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) to inform first-line therapy 
using a large real-world (rw) data set.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with NSCLC from an rw 
de-identified clinico-genomic database. All patients underwent genomic testing 
using Foundation Medicine's tissue comprehensive genomic profiling assay and 
PD-L1 IHC assay scored for tumor cell staining (TS).
RESULTS: Of 2165 patients included in the analysis, 150 exhibited durable 
benefit from first-line ICPI regimens (these patients were enriched for PD-L1 TS 
≥50, non-squamous histology, and TMB ≥20 mutations/megabase (muts/Mb)). 
Comparing low TMB (<10 muts/Mb), high TMB (10-19 muts/Mb), and very high TMB 
(≥20 muts/Mb) receiving ICPI alone, we observed a stepwise increase in median 
rwPFS (real world-progression free survival) (6.5, 7.5, 17.2 months) and rwOS 
(real world-overall survival) (10.1, 11.8, 26.9 months) as TMB increased. In the 
low PD-L1 (TS <50%) cohort, TMB <20 muts/Mb showed a more favorable rwPFS (HR: 
0.56 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.79)) and rwOS (HR 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.96)) on 
chemoICPI when compared with ICPI alone while the point estimate in rwPFS 
favored monoICPI in the TMB ≥20 muts/Mb cohort, the CI is wide and does not 
reach statistical significance (HR: 1.68 (95% CI: 0.52 to 5.48)).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that higher TMB cut-offs, such as 20 
muts/Mb, can identify patients with prolonged benefit from ICPI. TMB ≥20 muts/Mb 
is a potential biomarker that may identify patients in whom an ICPI without 
chemo could be considered, even in the setting of lower PD-L1 levels. 
Prospective validation of these findings could increase access to chemo-sparing 
regimens for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) generally occur in young 
school-age children, although can occur in adolescents and young adults. The 
purpose of this study was to describe clinical, radiological, pathologic, and 
molecular characteristics in patients ≥10 years of age with DIPG enrolled in the 
International DIPG Registry (IDIPGR).
METHODS: Patients ≥10 years of age at diagnosis enrolled in the IDIPGR with 
imaging confirmed DIPG diagnosis were included. The primary outcome was overall 
survival (OS) categorized as long-term survivors (LTS) (≥24 months) or 
short-term survivors (STS) (<24 months).
RESULTS: Among 1010 patients, 208 (21%) were ≥10 years of age at diagnosis; 152 
were eligible with a median age of 12 years (range 10-26.8). Median OS was 13 
(2-82) months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 59.2%, 5.3%, and 3.3%, 
respectively. The 18/152 (11.8%) LTS were more likely to be older (P < .01) and 
present with longer symptom duration (P < .01). Biopsy and/or autopsy were 
performed in 50 (33%) patients; 77%, 61%, 33%, and 6% of patients tested had 
H3K27M (H3F3A or HIST1H3B), TP53, ATRX, and ACVR1 mutations/genome alterations, 
respectively. Two of 18 patients with IDH1 testing were IDH1-mutant and 1 was a 
LTS. The presence or absence of H3 alterations did not affect survival.
CONCLUSION: Patients ≥10 years old with DIPG have a median survival of 13 
months. LTS present with longer symptom duration and are likely to be older at 
presentation compared to STS. ATRX mutation rates were higher in this population 
than the general DIPG population.

BACKGROUND: Malignancies are molecularly complex and become more resistant with 
each line of therapy. We hypothesized that offering matched, individualized 
combination therapies to patients with treatment-naïve, advanced cancers would 
be feasible and efficacious. Patients with newly diagnosed 
unresectable/metastatic, poor-prognosis cancers were enrolled in a 
cross-institutional prospective study.
METHODS: A total of 145 patients were included in the study. Genomic profiling 
(tissue and/or circulating tumor DNA) was performed in all patients, and PD-L1 
immunohistochemistry, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite status 
assessment were performed in a subset of patients. We evaluated safety and 
outcomes: disease-control rate (stable disease for ≥ 6 months or partial or 
complete response), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Seventy-six of 145 patients (52%) were treated, most commonly for 
non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers, carcinomas of unknown primary, and 
hepatobiliary malignancies (53% women; median age, 63 years). The median number 
of deleterious genomic alterations per patient was 5 (range, 0-15). Fifty-four 
treated patients (71%) received ≥ 1 molecularly matched therapy, demonstrating 
the feasibility of administering molecularly matched therapy. The Matching 
Score, which reflects the percentage of targeted alterations, correlated 
linearly with progression-free survival (R2 = 0.92; P = 0.01), and high (≥ 60%) 
Matching Score was an independent predictor of improved disease control rate [OR 
3.31 (95% CI 1.01-10.83), P = 0.048], PFS [HR 0.55 (0.28-1.07), P = 0.08], and 
OS [HR 0.42 (0.21-0.85), P = 0.02]. Serious adverse event rates were similar in 
the unmatched and matched groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Personalized combination therapies targeting a majority of a 
patient's molecular alterations have antitumor activity as first-line treatment. 
These findings underscore the feasibility and importance of using tailored 
N-of-1 combination therapies early in the course of lethal malignancies.

PURPOSE: Older adults are at increased risk for chemotherapy toxicity, and 
standard oncology assessment measures cannot identify those at risk. A 
predictive model for chemotherapy toxicity was developed (N = 500) that 
consisted of geriatric assessment questions and other clinical variables. This 
study aims to externally validate this model in an independent cohort (N = 250).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age ≥ 65 years with a solid tumor, fluent in 
English, and who were scheduled to receive a new chemotherapy regimen were 
recruited from eight institutions. Risk of chemotherapy toxicity was calculated 
(low, medium, or high risk) on the basis of the prediction model before the 
start of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-related toxicity was captured (grade 3 
[hospitalization indicated], grade 4 [life threatening], and grade 5 
[treatment-related death]). Validation of the prediction model was performed by 
calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The study sample (N = 250) had a mean age of 73 years (range, 65 to 94 
[standard deviation, 5.8]). More than one half of patients (58%) experienced 
grade ≥ 3 toxicity. Risk of toxicity increased with increasing risk score (36.7% 
low, 62.4% medium, 70.2% high risk; P < .001). The area under the curve of the 
receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.71), which 
was not statistically different from the development cohort (0.72; 95% CI, 0.68 
to 0.77; P = .09). There was no association between Karnofsky Performance Status 
and chemotherapy toxicity (P = .25).
CONCLUSION: This study externally validated a chemotherapy toxicity predictive 
model for older adults with cancer. This predictive model should be considered 
when discussing the risks and benefits of chemotherapy with older adults.

In animal societies, identity signals are common, mediate interactions within 
groups, and allow individuals to discriminate group-mates from out-group 
competitors. However, individual recognition becomes increasingly challenging as 
group size increases and as signals must be transmitted over greater distances. 
Group vocal signatures may evolve when successful in-group/out-group 
distinctions are at the crux of fitness-relevant decisions, but group signatures 
alone are insufficient when differentiated within-group relationships are 
important for decision-making. Spotted hyenas are social carnivores that live in 
stable clans of less than 125 individuals composed of multiple unrelated 
matrilines. Clan members cooperate to defend resources and communal territories 
from neighbouring clans and other mega carnivores; this collective defence is 
mediated by long-range (up to 5 km range) recruitment vocalizations, called 
whoops. Here, we use machine learning to determine that spotted hyena whoops 
contain individual but not group signatures, and that fundamental frequency 
features which propagate well are critical for individual discrimination. For 
effective clan-level cooperation, hyenas face the cognitive challenge of 
remembering and recognizing individual voices at long range. We show that serial 
redundancy in whoop bouts increases individual classification accuracy and thus 
extended call bouts used by hyenas probably evolved to overcome the challenges 
of communicating individual identity at long distance.

Here, we describe the use of artificial intelligence to identify novel agonists 
of the SH2-containing 5' inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). One of the compounds, 
K306, represents the most potent agonist identified to date. We find that K306 
exhibits selectivity for SHIP1 vs. the paralog enzyme SHIP2, and this activation 
does not require the C2 domain of SHIP1 which other known SHIP1 agonists 
require. Thus, K306 represents a new class of SHIP1 agonists with a novel mode 
of agonism. Importantly, we find that K306 can suppress induction of 
inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in macrophages or microglia, but not by their 
SHIP1-deficient counterparts. K306 also reduces TNF-α production in vivo in an 
LPS-induced endotoxemia assay. Finally, we show that K306 enhances 
phagolysosomal degradation of synaptosomes and dead neurons by microglia 
revealing a novel function for SHIP1 that might be exploited therapeutically in 
dementia.

PURPOSE: To study the impact of standard-of-care hormonal therapies on 
metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) clinical genomic profiles in real-world 
practice, with a focus on homologous recombination-repair (HRR) genes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing of 1,302 patients with 
mPC was pursued using the FoundationOne or FoundationOne CDx assays. 
Longitudinal clinical data for correlative analysis were curated via 
technology-enabled abstraction of electronic health records. Genomic biomarkers, 
including individual gene aberrations and genome-wide loss-of-heterozygosity 
(gLOH) scores, were compared according to biopsy location and time of sample 
acquisition (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]-naïve, ADT-progression and 
post-ADT, and novel hormonal therapies [NHT]-progression), using chi-square and 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Multivariable analysis used linear regression. 
False-discovery rate of 0.05 was applied to account for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Eight hundred forty (65%), 132 (10%), and 330 (25%) biopsies were 
ADT-naïve, ADT-progression, and NHT-progression, respectively. Later-stage 
samples were enriched for AR, MYC, TP53, PTEN, and RB1 aberrations (all adjusted 
P values < .05), but prevalence of HRR-related BRCA2, ATM, and CDK12 aberrations 
remained stable. Primary and metastatic ADT-naïve biopsies presented similar 
prevalence of TP53 (36% v 31%) and BRCA2 (8% v 7%) aberrations; 81% of ADT-naïve 
BRCA2-mutated samples presented BRCA2 biallelic loss. Higher gLOH scores were 
independently associated with HRR genes (BRCA2, PALB2, and FANCA), TP53, and RB1 
aberrations, and with prior exposure to hormonal therapies in multivariable 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of HRR-gene aberrations remains stable along mPC 
progression, supporting the use of diagnostic biopsies to guide poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor treatment in metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer. gLOH scores increase with emerging resistance to hormonal 
therapies, independently of individual HRR gene mutations.

Blood-based microarray studies comparing individuals affected with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing individuals help characterize 
differences in circulating immune cell functions and offer potential biomarker 
signal. We sought to combine the subject-level data from previously published 
studies by mega-analysis to increase the statistical power. We identified 
studies that compared ex vivo blood or lymphocytes from ASD-affected individuals 
and unrelated comparison subjects using Affymetrix or Illumina array platforms. 
Raw microarray data and clinical meta-data were obtained from seven studies, 
totaling 626 affected and 447 comparison subjects. Microarray data were 
processed using uniform methods. Covariate-controlled mixed-effect linear models 
were used to identify gene transcripts and co-expression network modules that 
were significantly associated with diagnostic status. Permutation-based gene-set 
analysis was used to identify functionally related sets of genes that were over- 
and under-expressed among ASD samples. Our results were consistent with 
diminished interferon-, EGF-, PDGF-, PI3K-AKT-mTOR-, and RAS-MAPK-signaling 
cascades, and increased ribosomal translation and NK-cell related activity in 
ASD. We explored evidence for sex-differences in the ASD-related transcriptomic 
signature. We also demonstrated that machine-learning classifiers using blood 
transcriptome data perform with moderate accuracy when data are combined across 
studies. Comparing our results with those from blood-based studies of protein 
biomarkers (e.g., cytokines and trophic factors), we propose that ASD may 
feature decoupling between certain circulating signaling proteins (higher in ASD 
samples) and the transcriptional cascades which they typically elicit within 
circulating immune cells (lower in ASD samples). These findings provide insight 
into ASD-related transcriptional differences in circulating immune cells. © 2016

The clinical presentation, course and treatment of methamphetamine 
(METH)-associated psychosis (MAP) are similar to that observed in schizophrenia 
(SCZ) and subsequently MAP has been hypothesized as a pharmacological and 
environmental model of SCZ. However, several challenges currently exist in 
diagnosing MAP accurately at the molecular and neurocognitive level before the 
MAP model can contribute to the discovery of SCZ biomarkers. We directly 
assessed subcortical brain structural volumes and clinical parameters of MAP 
within the framework of an integrative genome-wide RNA-Seq blood transcriptome 
analysis of subjects diagnosed with MAP (N=10), METH dependency without 
psychosis (MA; N=10) and healthy controls (N=10). First, we identified discrete 
groups of co-expressed genes (that is, modules) and tested them for functional 
annotation and phenotypic relationships to brain structure volumes, life events 
and psychometric measurements. We discovered one MAP-associated module involved 
in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis downregulation, enriched with 61 genes 
previously found implicated in psychosis and SCZ across independent blood and 
post-mortem brain studies using convergent functional genomic (CFG) evidence. 
This module demonstrated significant relationships with brain structure volumes 
including the anterior corpus callosum (CC) and the nucleus accumbens. 
Furthermore, a second MAP and psychoticism-associated module involved in 
circadian clock upregulation was also enriched with 39 CFG genes, further 
associated with the CC. Subsequently, a machine-learning analysis of 
differentially expressed genes identified single blood-based biomarkers able to 
differentiate controls from methamphetamine dependents with 87% accuracy and MAP 
from MA subjects with 95% accuracy. CFG evidence validated a significant 
proportion of these putative MAP biomarkers in independent studies including 
CLN3, FBP1, TBC1D2 and ZNF821 (RNA degradation), ELK3 and SINA3 (circadian 
clock) and PIGF and UHMK1 (ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis). Finally, focusing 
analysis on brain structure volumes revealed significantly lower bilateral 
hippocampal volumes in MAP subjects. Overall, these results suggest similar 
molecular and neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of 
psychosis and SCZ regardless of substance abuse and provide preliminary evidence 
supporting the MAP paradigm as an exemplar for SCZ biomarker discovery.

Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) is an enzyme of the urea cycle, which converts 
ammonia into urea in the liver cells. OTC plays a crucial role in the breakdown 
and removal of nitrogen in the body. OTC deficiency is a rare X-linked recessive 
disorder that classically presents in early life with signs of hyperammonemia 
and progressive central nervous system involvement resulting in seizures, coma, 
and death. Sentinel presentation in adulthood is quite rare. A 29-year-old man 
developed altered mental status after receiving an epidural steroid injection 
3 days earlier for back pain. He presented to the emergency department severely 
agitated, and his workup revealed an elevated ammonia level of 125 µmol/L. He 
refused admission and was discharged against medical advice. The following day, 
his mentation deteriorated, he developed status epilepticus, and was transported 
to another emergency department. He was admitted with worsening hyperammonemia 
(levels rising to over 700 µmol/L). His clinical condition progressive 
deteriorated, and he developed encephalopathy and diffuse cerebral edema. Liver 
function testing indicated progressive liver damage, and amino acids were 
detected in his blood and urine. Clinical and laboratory findings suggested 
undiagnosed OTC enzyme deficiency. He died 2 days after admission. An autopsy 
showed an 1890 g liver with diffuse yellow discoloration and softening. 
Histology and electron microscopy revealed findings suggestive of urea cycle 
disorder, such as microvesicular steatosis, apoptosis, and scattered mitosis, 
clusters of clear hepatocytes at the PAS stain, and mitochondria abnormalities. 
Genetic analysis revealed a hemizygous pathogenic variant of the OTC gene 
(c.622G>A). OTC deficiency should be suspected in subjects with hyperammonemic 
encephalopathy. If a genetic mutation is identified in the deceased, surviving 
family members should be screened to prevent potential life-threatening 
complications.

22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder associated with 
numerous phenotypic consequences and is one of the greatest known risk factors 
for psychosis. We investigated intrinsic-connectivity-networks (ICNs) as 
potential biomarkers for patient and psychosis-risk status in 2 independent 
cohorts, UCLA (33 22q11DS-participants, 33 demographically matched controls), 
and Syracuse (28 22q11DS, 28 controls). After assessing group connectivity 
differences, ICNs from the UCLA cohort were used to train classifiers to 
distinguish cases from controls, and to predict psychosis risk status within 
22q11DS; classifiers were subsequently tested on the Syracuse cohort. In both 
cohorts we observed significant hypoconnectivity in 22q11DS relative to controls 
within anterior cingulate (ACC)/precuneus, executive, default mode (DMN), 
posterior DMN, and salience networks. Of 12 ICN-derived classifiers tested in 
the Syracuse replication-cohort, the ACC/precuneus, DMN, and posterior DMN 
classifiers accurately distinguished between 22q11DS and controls. Within 
22q11DS subjects, connectivity alterations within 4 networks predicted psychosis 
risk status for a given individual in both cohorts: the ACC/precuneus, DMN, left 
executive, and salience networks. Widespread within-network-hypoconnectivity in 
large-scale networks implicated in higher-order cognition may be a defining 
characteristic of 22q11DS during adolescence and early adulthood; furthermore, 
loss of coherence within these networks may be a valuable biomarker for 
individual prediction of psychosis-risk in 22q11DS.

PURPOSE: The Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) report of the Scoliosis Research 
Society (SRS) has been collected since 1965 and since 1968 submission of 
complications has been required of all members. Since 2009, the SRS has 
collected information on death, blindness, and neurological deficit, with acute 
infection being added in 2012 and unintentional return to the operating room 
(OR) being added in 2017. In this report, we use the most recent data submitted 
to the SRS M&M database to determine the rate of neurological deficit, 
blindness, acute infection, unintentional return to the OR, and death, while 
also comparing this information to previous reports.
METHODS: The SRS M&M database was queried for all cases from 2013 to 2020. The 
rates of death, vision loss, neurological deficit, acute infection, and 
unintentional return to the OR were then calculated and analyzed. The rates were 
compared to previously published data if available. Differences in complication 
rates between years were analyzed with Poisson regression with significance set 
at α = 0.05.
RESULTS: The total number of cases submitted per year varied with a maximum of 
49,615 in 2018 and a minimum of 40,464 in 2020. The overall reported 
complication rate from 2013 to 2020 was 2.86%. The overall mortality rate ranged 
from 0.09% in 2018 to 0.14% in 2015. The number of patients with visual 
impairment ranged from 4 to 13 between 2013 and 2015 (no data on visual 
impairment were collected after 2015). The overall infection rate varied from 
0.95 in 2020 to 1.30% in 2015. When the infection rate was analyzed based on 
spinal deformity group, the neuromuscular scoliosis group consistently had the 
highest infection rate ranging from 3.24 to 3.94%. The overall neurological 
deficit rate ranged from 0.74 to 0.94%, with the congenital kyphosis and 
dysplastic spondylolisthesis groups having the highest rates. The rates of 
unintentional return to the OR ranged from 1.60 to 1.79%. Multiple groups showed 
a statistically significant decreasing trend for infection, return to the 
operating room, neurologic deficit, and death.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular scoliosis had the highest infection rate among all 
spinal deformity groups. Congenital kyphosis and dysplastic spondylolisthesis 
had the highest rate of neurological deficit postoperatively. This is similar to 
previously published data. Contrary to previous reports, neuromuscular scoliosis 
did not have the highest annual death rate. Multiple groups showed a 
statistically significant decreasing trend in complication rates during the 
reporting period, with only mortality in degenerative spondylolisthesis 
significantly trending upwards.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for gender dysphoria is medical intervention, 
but many transgender and nonbinary people face significant treatment barriers 
when seeking help for gender dysphoria. When untreated, gender dysphoria is 
associated with depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance misuse. 
Technology-delivered interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be 
used discretely, safely, and flexibly, thereby reducing treatment barriers and 
increasing access to psychological interventions to manage distress that 
accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered interventions are beginning 
to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to 
automate intervention components and tailor intervention content. A critical 
step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating 
how accurately these methods model clinical constructs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the preliminary effectiveness of 
modeling gender dysphoria with ML and NLP, using transgender and nonbinary 
people's social media data.
METHODS: Overall, 6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were 
used to model gender dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit (Reddit Inc) 
posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific web-based forums. After 
developing a codebook grounded in clinical science, a research team of 
clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary 
clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria 
was present in each Reddit post (ie, the dependent variable). NLP (eg, n-grams, 
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, word embedding, sentiment, and transfer 
learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post into 
predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. 
Hyperparameters were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed 
to demonstrate the relative importance of each NLP-generated independent 
variable in predicting gender dysphoria. Misclassified posts were analyzed to 
improve future modeling of gender dysphoria.
RESULTS: Results indicated that a supervised ML algorithm (ie, optimized extreme 
gradient boosting [XGBoost]) modeled gender dysphoria with a high degree of 
accuracy (0.84), precision (0.83), and speed (1.23 seconds). Of the 
NLP-generated independent variables, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) clinical keywords (eg, dysphoria and disorder) 
were most predictive of gender dysphoria. Misclassifications of gender dysphoria 
were common in posts that expressed uncertainty, featured a stressful experience 
unrelated to gender dysphoria, were incorrectly coded, expressed insufficient 
linguistic markers of gender dysphoria, described past experiences of gender 
dysphoria, showed evidence of identity exploration, expressed aspects of human 
sexuality unrelated to gender dysphoria, described socially based gender 
dysphoria, expressed strong affective or cognitive reactions unrelated to gender 
dysphoria, or discussed body image.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria 
have significant potential to be integrated into technology-delivered 
interventions. The results contribute to the growing evidence on the importance 
of incorporating ML and NLP designs in clinical science, especially when 
studying marginalized populations.

PURPOSE: Chest X-ray plays a key role in diagnosis and management of COVID-19 
patients and imaging features associated with clinical elements may assist with 
the development or validation of automated image analysis tools. We aimed to 
identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to 
assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting 
of an acute COVID-19 outbreak.
METHODS: A retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was 
performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 60±17 years, 15 
women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in 
Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for 
alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 
to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for 
association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or 
endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung 
segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to 
clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. 
Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to 
conventional radiologist interpretation.
RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% 
had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar 
or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and 
comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on 
baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal 
tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In 
comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa 
concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities.
CONCLUSION: Chest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the 
severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well 
as acuity of care. Artificial intelligence tools based upon deep learning of 
COVID-19 chest X-rays are feasible in the acute outbreak setting.

BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a biomarker for response to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). PD-1 inhibitors in metastatic colorectal 
carcinoma (mCRC) with MSI-high (MSI-H) have demonstrated a high disease control 
rate and favorable progression-free survival (PFS); however, reported response 
rates to pembrolizumab and nivolumab are variable and often <50%, suggesting 
that additional predictive biomarkers are needed.
METHODS: Clinicopathologic data were collected from patients with MSI-H mCRC 
confirmed by hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) treated with 
PD-1/L1 inhibitors at five institutes. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was 
determined on 0.8-1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and reported as mutations/Mb. 
Potential biomarkers of response and time to progression were analyzed by 
univariate and multivariate analyses. Once TMB was confirmed as a predictive 
biomarker, a larger dataset of 18 140 unique CRC patients was analyzed to define 
the relevance of the identified TMB cut-point.
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were treated with PD-1/L1 inhibitors including 
19 with pembrolizumab monotherapy. Among tested variables, TMB showed the 
strongest association with objective response (OR; P < 0.001) and PFS, by 
univariate (P < 0.001) and multivariate analysis (P < 0.01). Using log-rank 
statistics, the optimal predictive cut-point for TMB was estimated between 37 
and 41 mutations/Mb. All 13 TMBhigh cases responded, while 6/9 TMBlow cases had 
progressive disease. The median PFS for TMBhigh has not been reached (median 
follow-up >18 months) while the median PFS for TMBlow was 2 months. A TMB of 
37.4 mutations/Mb in a large MSI-H mCRC population (821/18, 140 cases; 4.5%) 
evaluated by NGS corresponded to the 35th percentile cut-point.
CONCLUSIONS: TMB appears to be an important independent biomarker within MSI-H 
mCRC to stratify patients for likelihood of response to ICPIs. If validated in 
prospective studies, TMB may play an important role in guiding the sequencing 
and/or combinations of ICPIs in MSI-H mCRC.

Species distribution modeling often involves high-dimensional environmental 
data. Large amounts of data and multicollinearity among covariates impose 
challenges to statistical models in variable selection for reliable inferences 
of the effects of environmental factors on the spatial distribution of species. 
Few studies have evaluated and compared the performance of multiple machine 
learning (ML) models in handling multicollinearity. Here, we assessed the 
effectiveness of removal of correlated covariates and regularization to cope 
with multicollinearity in ML models for habitat suitability. Three machine 
learning algorithms maximum entropy (MaxEnt), random forests (RFs), and support 
vector machines (SVMs) were applied to the original data (OD) of 27 landscape 
variables, reduced data (RD) with 14 highly correlated covariates being removed, 
and 15 principal components (PC) of the OD accounting for 90% of the original 
variability. The performance of the three ML models was measured with the area 
under the curve and continuous Boyce index. We collected 663 nonduplicated 
presence locations of Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) 
across the state of Mississippi, United States. Of the total locations, 453 
locations separated by a distance of ≥2 km were used to train the three ML 
algorithms on the OD, RD, and PC data, respectively. The remaining 210 locations 
were used to validate the trained ML models to measure ML performance. Three ML 
models had excellent performance on the RD and PC data. MaxEnt and SVMs had good 
performance on the OD data, indicating the adequacy of regularization of the 
default setting for multicollinearity. Weak learning of RFs through bagging 
appeared to alleviate multicollinearity and resulted in excellent performance on 
the OD data. Regularization of ML algorithms may help exploratory studies of the 
effects of environmental factors on the spatial distribution and habitat 
suitability of wildlife.

Identifying genes whose expression is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) risk 
by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) facilitates downstream 
experimental studies. Here, we integrated multiple published datasets of TWAS, 
gene coexpression, and differential gene expression analysis to prioritize SCZ 
candidate genes for functional study. Convergent evidence prioritized 
Propionyl-CoA Carboxylase Subunit Beta (PCCB), a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial 
gene, as an SCZ risk gene. However, the PCCB's contribution to SCZ risk has not 
been investigated before. Using dual luciferase reporter assay, we identified 
that SCZ-associated SNPs rs6791142 and rs35874192, two eQTL SNPs for PCCB, 
showed differential allelic effects on transcriptional activities. PCCB 
knockdown in human forebrain organoids (hFOs) followed by RNA sequencing 
analysis revealed dysregulation of genes enriched with multiple neuronal 
functions including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synapse. The 
metabolomic and mitochondrial function analyses confirmed the decreased GABA 
levels resulted from inhibited tricarboxylic acid cycle in PCCB knockdown hFOs. 
Multielectrode array recording analysis showed that PCCB knockdown in hFOs 
resulted into SCZ-related phenotypes including hyper-neuroactivities and 
decreased synchronization of neural network. In summary, this study utilized 
hFOs-based multi-omics analyses and revealed that PCCB downregulation may 
contribute to SCZ risk through regulating GABAergic pathways, highlighting the 
mitochondrial function in SCZ.

Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne flavivirus that encompasses two genetic 
lineages, POWV (Lineage I) and deer tick virus (DTV, Lineage II). In recent 
years, the incidence of reported POWV disease cases has increased, coupled with 
an expanded geographic range of the DTV tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. POWV and 
DTV are serologically indistinguishable, and it is not known whether clinical 
manifestations, pathology, or disease outcome differ between the two viruses. 
Six-week-old male and female BALB/c mice were footpad-inoculated with DTV doses 
ranging from 101 to 105 FFU. Dose-independent mortality, morbidity, and organ 
viral loads were observed for mice inoculated with sequentially increasing doses 
of DTV. By study completion, all surviving mice had cleared their viremias but 
detectable levels of negative-sense DTV RNA were present in the brain, 
indicating viral persistence of infectious DTV in the central nervous system. 
For mice that succumbed to disease, neuropathology revealed meningoencephalitis 
characterized by microscopic lesions with widespread distribution of viral RNA 
in the brain. These findings, coupled with the rapid onset of neurological signs 
of disease and high viral titers in nervous tissue, highlight the neurotropism 
of DTV in this mouse model. Additionally, disease outcome for DTV-infected mice 
was not affected by sex, as males and females were equally susceptible to 
disease. This is the first study to comprehensively characterize the clinical 
disease outcome in a small animal model across a spectrum of POWV/DTV infection 
doses. Here, we developed a small animal model for DTV pathogenesis that mimics 
the manifestations of POWV disease in humans. Since it is currently not known 
whether DTV and POWV differ in their capacity to cause human disease, the animal 
model detailed in our study could be utilized in future comparative pathogenesis 
studies, or as a platform for testing the efficacy of vaccines, and anti-virals.

Many studies have discussed clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of 
cystitis and pyelonephritis. Treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) can be based on empiric antibiotic therapy. For complicated or recurrent 
UTIs, therapy can be based on laboratory-controlled culture and sensitivity 
(C&S) reports. The diagnosis of UTI by clinical criteria alone has an error rate 
of up to 33%. In addition, positive laboratory culture results do not always 
indicate a diagnosis of UTI. Comparison of urine in a conventional culture model 
versus DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) to accurately identify and provide 
information on resistance factors (mobile genetic elements) is warranted. Our 
study was a head-to-head comparative phase II study of standard urine C&S versus 
DNA NGS testing for the diagnosis and treatment efficacy in patients with 
symptoms of acute cystitis based on short-term outcomes.

The rarity of malignant Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells in classic 
Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) limits the ability to study the genomics of cHL. To 
circumvent this, our group has previously optimized fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting to purify HRS cells. Using this approach, we now report the whole-genome 
sequencing landscape of HRS cells and reconstruct the chronology and likely 
etiology of pathogenic events leading to cHL. We identified alterations in 
driver genes not previously described in cHL, APOBEC mutational activity, and 
the presence of complex structural variants including chromothripsis. We found 
that high ploidy in cHL is often acquired through multiple, independent 
chromosomal gains events including whole-genome duplication. Evolutionary timing 
analyses revealed that structural variants enriched for RAG motifs, driver 
mutations in B2M, BCL7A, GNA13, and PTPN1, and the onset of AID-driven 
mutagenesis usually preceded large chromosomal gains. This study provides a 
temporal reconstruction of cHL pathogenesis.
SIGNIFICANCE: Previous studies in cHL were limited to coding sequences and 
therefore not able to comprehensively decipher the tumor complexity. Here, 
leveraging cHL whole-genome characterization, we identify driver events and 
reconstruct the tumor evolution, finding that structural variants, driver 
mutations, and AID mutagenesis precede chromosomal gains. This article is 
highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 171.

BACKGROUND: Genomic studies of high-grade/progressive meningiomas have reported 
a heterogeneous mutation spectrum, identifying few recurrently mutated genes. 
Most studies have been underpowered to detect genomic subclasses of aggressive 
meningiomas due to relatively small number of available samples. Here, we 
present a genomic survey of one of the largest multi-institutional cohorts of 
high-grade/progressive meningiomas to date.
METHODS: 850 high-grade/progressive meningiomas, including 441 WHO grade 2 and 
176 WHO grade 3 meningiomas and 220 progressive WHO grade 1 meningiomas, were 
tested as part of a clinical testing program by hybridization capture of 406 
cancer-related genes to detect base substitutions, indels, amplifications, 
deletions, and rearrangements. Information from pathology reports, 
histopathology review, and patient clinical data was assessed.
RESULTS: Genomic analyses converged to identify at least three distinct patterns 
of biologically-aggressive meningiomas. The first and most common contained 
NF2-mutant tumors (n = 426, 50%), was associated with male sex (64.4% %, 
p = 0.0001) and often harbored additional mutations in CDKN2A/B (24%), and the 
chromatin regulators ARID1A (9%), and KDM6A (6%). A second group (NF2-agnostic) 
featured TERT promoter (TERTp; n = 56) or TP53 mutations (n = 25) and were 
either NF2-mutant or wild-type, and displayed no association with either sex 
(p = 0.39). The remaining group generally lacked NF2 mutations, and accounted 
for 40% of the cases-with three subgroups. One consistent primarily of grade 3 
lesions harboring alterations in chromatin regulators BAP1 (n = 22) or PBRM1 
(n = 16). A second subgroup contained AKT1 (n = 26), PIK3CA (n = 14) and SMO 
(n = 7) mutant skull-based meningiomas, and a third mixed subgroup included 237 
meningiomas with a heterogeneous spectrum of low frequency and non-recurrent 
alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the patterns of genomic alterations in 
high-grade/progressive meningiomas commonly group into three different 
categories. The most common NF2-associated canonical group frequently harbored 
CDKN2A/B alterations, which is potentially amenable to targeted therapies. An 
NF2-agnostic group harbored frequent TERTp and TP53 mutations. The final 
subclass, distinct from the canonical NF2 mutant associated pathway, was partly 
characterized by BAP1/PBRM1 alterations (rhabdoid/papillary histology) or 
skull-base disease. Overall, these data increase our understanding of the 
pathobiology of high-grade/progressive meningiomas and can guide the design of 
clinical trials.

Mutant analysis by rescue gene excision: New tools for mosaic studies in 
Drosophila.

A host of classical and molecular genetic tools make Drosophila a tremendous 
model for the dissection of gene activity. In particular, the FLP-FRT technique 
for mitotic recombination has greatly enhanced gene loss-of-function analysis. 
This technique efficiently induces formation of homozygous mutant clones in 
tissues of heterozygous organisms. However, the dependence of the FLP-FRT method 
on cell division, and other constraints, also impose limits on its 
effectiveness. We describe here the generation and testing of tools for Mutant 
Analysis by Rescue Gene Excision (MARGE), an approach whereby mutant cells are 
formed by loss of a rescue transgene in a homozygous mutant organism. 
Rescue-transgene loss can be induced in any tissue or cell-type and at any time 
during development or in the adult using available heat-shock-induced or 
tissue-specific flippases, or combinations of UAS-FLP with Gal4 and Gal80ts 
reagents. The simultaneous loss of a constitutive fluorescence marker (GFP or 
RFP) identifies the mutant cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of the MARGE 
technique by flip-out (clonal and disc-wide) of a Ubi-GFP-carrying construct in 
imaginal discs, and by inducing a known yki mutant phenotype in the Drosophila 
ovary.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous disorder with 
a high degree of psychiatric and physical comorbidity, which complicates its 
diagnosis in childhood and adolescence. We analyzed registry data from 238,696 
persons born and living in Sweden between 1995 and 1999. Several machine 
learning techniques were used to assess the ability of registry data to inform 
the diagnosis of ADHD in childhood and adolescence: logistic regression, random 
Forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, penalized logistic regression, deep neural 
network (DNN), and ensemble models. The best fitting model was the DNN, 
achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75, 95% 
CI (0.74-0.76) and balanced accuracy of 0.69. At the 0.45 probability threshold, 
sensitivity was 71.66% and specificity was 65.0%. There was an overall agreement 
in the feature importance among all models (τ > .5). The top 5 features 
contributing to classification were having a parent with criminal convictions, 
male sex, having a relative with ADHD, number of academic subjects failed, and 
speech/learning disabilities. A DNN model predicting childhood and adolescent 
ADHD trained exclusively on Swedish register data achieved good discrimination. 
If replicated and validated in an external sample, and proven to be 
cost-effective, this model could be used to alert clinicians to individuals who 
ought to be screened for ADHD and to aid clinicians' decision-making with the 
goal of decreasing misdiagnoses. Further research is needed to validate results 
in different populations and to incorporate new predictors.

IMPORTANCE: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a putative biomarker of efficacy 
for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies of solid tumors, but not 
specifically for penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC).
OBJECTIVE: To characterize biomarker features and ICI therapy outcomes 
associated with high TMB in PSCC in the routine clinical practice setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, 397 PSCC cases were 
analyzed to identify genomic alterations in more than 300 cancer-associated 
genes and genomic signatures, including TMB, using a hybrid capture-based 
comprehensive genomic profiling assay. Tumor mutational burden was categorized 
as low (<10 mutations per megabase [mut/Mb]), high (10-19 mut/Mb), or very high 
(≥20 mut/Mb). Germline status of genetic alterations was predicted using a 
validated somatic-germline computational method. Clinical outcomes of patients 
with metastatic PSCC receiving first-line ICI were abstracted using the 
deidentified nationwide Clinico-Genomic Database (CGDB) from January 1, 2011, 
through December 31, 2022.
EXPOSURE: Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed using FoundationOne and 
FoundationOne CDx assays from Foundation Medicine Inc.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The spectrum of genetic alterations by TMB level in 
PSCC, the percentage of germline genetic alterations, and the outcome (overall 
survival with routine clinical treatment) by TMB of chemotherapy-naive patients 
with PSCC who received ICI treatment up front were assessed in this descriptive 
study.
RESULTS: Among 397 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [54-73] years; 266 [67.0%] of 
European, 83 [20.9%] of admixed American, and 34 [8.5%] of African or other 
genomic ancestry), the median (IQR) age (eg, 65 [53-73] years for low TMB vs 68 
[61-78] years for TMB ≥10 mut/Mb) and genomic ancestry distribution (eg, 
European 228 of 339 [67.3%] for low TMB vs 38 of 58 [65.5%] for TMB ≥10 mut/Mb) 
were similar between TMB subgroups. There were 339 PSCC cases (85.4%) with low 
TMB, 40 cases (10.1%) with high TMB, and 18 cases (4.5%) with very high TMB. 
Comparisons of TMB of 10 mut/Mb or higher vs low TMB showed an enrichment of 
genetic alterations in PIK3CA (48.3% vs 18.3%; P < .001) and KMT2D (29.3% vs 
7.7%; P < .001) and less frequent genetic alterations in CDKN2A (25.9% vs 45.7%; 
P = .05). Most genetic alterations did not co-occur. Human papillomavirus 
identification was more frequent as TMB increased: 28.3% for low TMB, 50.0% for 
high, and 72.2% for very high. In total, 95 of 1377 genetic alterations (6.9%) 
were germline. Of 10 patients identified from the CGDB receiving frontline ICIs, 
median (IQR) follow-up was 9.9 months. Four patients had overall survival with 
clinical treatment of more than 12 months, including 2 of 3 patients with TMB of 
10 mut/Mb or higher.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of advanced metastatic PSCC 
based on TMB levels, significant differences were observed for biomarkers in 
nearly 15% of patients with a TMB of 10 mut/Mb or higher. Germline testing and 
ICI-based therapy should be integrated into the management of selected PSCC 
cases.

OBJECTIVE: Understanding the role of endophenotypes is essential for process 
models of psychopathology. This study examined which candidate cognitive 
endophenotypes statistically mediate common variant genetic risk for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHOD: A case-control design using community-recruited volunteer children 7 to 
11 years of age (n = 656, n = 435 ADHD), of whom 514 were of homogenous European 
ancestry for the primary models (n = 337 ADHD, 177 non-ADHD). Children were 
assessed with a multi-informant, best-estimate diagnostic procedure and 
laboratory measures of working memory, response inhibition, executive 
functioning, arousal/attention, temporal information processing, and processing 
speed. Latent variables were created for the candidate cognitive measures and 
for parent- and teacher-rated ADHD dimensions. Polygenic risk scores (PGS) were 
computed using a discovery sample of 20,183 individuals with ADHD and 35,191 
controls from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium. Cognitive measures that 
survived multiple testing correction for association with the PGS were evaluated 
for mediation with ADHD using structural equation models.
RESULTS: Results were essentially identical in the homogeneous European ancestry 
subgroup (n = 514) and in the full sample (N = 656). For the European 
population, the PGS was associated with ADHD diagnosis (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.045; 
β = 0.233, SE = 0.053, p = .000011) and multi-indicator dimensional ADHD latent 
variables by parent report (β = 0.185, SE = 0.043) and teacher report (β = 
0.165, SE = 0.042). The PGS effect was statistically mediated by working memory 
(indirect effect, β = 0.101, SE = 0.029, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.16, p = .00049, 43% of 
genetic effect accounted for) and arousal/alertness (indirect effect β = 0.115, 
95% CI = 0.04, 0.20, SE = 0.041, p = .005, 49% of genetic effect accounted for).
CONCLUSION: This is the first clear demonstration from molecular genetic data 
that working memory and arousal regulation are promising cognitive 
endophenotypes for ADHD with regard to mediating genetic risk from common 
genetic variants.

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can boost risk prediction in late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease (LOAD) beyond apolipoprotein E (APOE) but have not been leveraged to 
identify genetic resilience factors. Here, we sought to identify 
resilience-conferring common genetic variants in (1) unaffected individuals 
having high PRSs for LOAD, and (2) unaffected APOE-ε4 carriers also having high 
PRSs for LOAD. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) to contrast 
"resilient" unaffected individuals at the highest genetic risk for LOAD with 
LOAD cases at comparable risk. From GWAS results, we constructed polygenic 
resilience scores to aggregate the addictive contributions of risk-orthogonal 
common variants that promote resilience to LOAD. Replication of resilience 
scores was undertaken in eight independent studies. We successfully replicated 
two polygenic resilience scores that reduce genetic risk penetrance for LOAD. We 
also showed that polygenic resilience scores positively correlate with polygenic 
risk scores in unaffected individuals, perhaps aiding in staving off disease. 
Our findings align with the hypothesis that a combination of risk-independent 
common variants mediates resilience to LOAD by moderating genetic disease risk.

Extended spectrum β-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL E. coli) is a 
primary concern for hospital and community healthcare settings, often linked to 
an increased incidence of nosocomial infections. This study investigated the 
characteristics of ESBL E. coli isolated from hospital environments and clinical 
samples. In total, 117 ESBL E. coli isolates were obtained. The isolates were 
subjected to molecular analysis for the presence of resistance and virulence 
genes, antibiotic susceptibility testing, quantitative adherence assay, ERIC-PCR 
for phylogenetic analysis and whole genome sequencing of four highly drug 
resistant isolates. Out of the 117 isolates, 68.4% were positive for blaCTX-M, 
39.3% for blaTEM, 30.8% for blaNDM-1, 13.7% for blaOXA and 1.7% for blaSHV gene. 
Upon screening for diarrheagenic genes, no isolates were found to harbour any of 
the tested genes. In the case of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) 
virulence factors, 7.6%, 11%, 5.9%, 4.3% and 21.2% of isolates harbored the 
focG, kpsMII, sfaS, afa and iutA genes, respectively. At a temperature of 25°C, 
14.5% of isolates exhibited strong biofilm formation with 21.4% and 28.2% 
exhibiting moderate and weak biofilm formation respectively, whereas 35.9% were 
non-biofilm formers. On the other hand at 37°C, 2.6% of isolates showed strong 
biofilm formation with 3.4% and 31.6% showing moderate and weak biofilm 
formation respectively, whereas, 62.4% were non-biofilm formers. Regarding 
antibiotic susceptibility testing, all isolates were found to be 
multidrug-resistant (MDR), with 30 isolates being highly drug resistant. 
ERIC-PCR resulted in 12 clusters, with cluster E-10 containing the maximum 
number of isolates. Hierarchical clustering and correlation analysis revealed 
associations between environmental and clinical isolates, indicating likely 
transmission and dissemination from the hospital environment to the patients. 
The whole genome sequencing of four highly drug resistant ExPEC isolates showed 
the presence of various antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence factors and 
mobile genetic elements, with isolates harbouring the plasmid incompatibility 
group IncF (FII, FIB, FIA). The sequenced isolates were identified as human 
pathogens with a 93.3% average score. This study suggests that ESBL producing E. 
coli are prevalent in the healthcare settings of Bangladesh, acting as a 
potential reservoir for AMR bacteria. This information may have a profound 
effect on treatment, and improvements in public healthcare policies are a 
necessity to combat the increased incidences of hospital-acquired infections in 
the country.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with bipolar disorder (BD), but what 
the causal variants are and how they contribute to BD is largely unknown. In 
this study, we used FUMA, a GWAS annotation tool, to pinpoint potential causal 
variants and genes from the latest BD GWAS findings, and performed integrative 
analyses, including brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), gene 
coexpression network, differential gene expression, protein-protein interaction, 
and brain intermediate phenotype association analysis to identify the functions 
of a prioritized gene and its connection to BD. Convergent lines of evidence 
prioritized protein-coding gene G Protein Nucleolar 3 (GNL3) as a BD risk gene, 
with integrative analyses revealing GNL3's roles in cell proliferation, neuronal 
functions, and brain phenotypes. We experimentally revealed that BD-related eQTL 
SNPs rs10865973, rs12635140, and rs4687644 regulate GNL3 expression using dual 
luciferase reporter assay and CRISPR interference experiment in human neural 
progenitor cells. We further identified that GNL3 knockdown and overexpression 
led to aberrant neuronal proliferation and differentiation, using 
two-dimensional human neural cell cultures and three-dimensional forebrain 
organoid model. This study gathers evidence that BD-related genetic variants 
regulate GNL3 expression which subsequently affects neuronal proliferation and 
differentiation.

PURPOSE: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) was added to the Recommended Uniform 
Screening Panel (RUSP) in July 2018, following FDA approval of the first 
effective SMA treatment, and demonstration of feasibility of high-throughput 
newborn screening using a primary molecular assay. SMA newborn screening was 
implemented in New York State (NYS) on 1 October 2018.
METHODS: Screening was conducted using DNA extracted from dried blood spots with 
a multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay 
targeting the recurrent SMN1 exon 7 gene deletion.
RESULTS: During the first year, 225,093 infants were tested. Eight screened 
positive, were referred for follow-up, and confirmed to be homozygous for the 
deletion. Infants with two or three copies of the SMN2 gene, predicting more 
severe, earlier-onset SMA, were treated with antisense oligonucleotide and/or 
gene therapy. One infant with ≥4 copies SMN2 also received gene therapy.
CONCLUSION: Newborn screening permits presymptomatic SMA diagnosis, when 
treatment initiation is most beneficial. At 1 in 28,137 (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1 in 14,259 to 55,525), the NYS SMA incidence is 2.6- to 4.7-fold lower 
than expected. The low SMA incidence is likely attributable to imprecise and 
biased estimates, coupled with increased awareness, access to and uptake of 
carrier screening, genetic counseling, cascade testing, prenatal diagnosis, and 
advanced reproductive technologies.

Handling of laboratory mice affects animal wellbeing and behavioural test 
outcomes. However, present research has focused on handling effects in common 
strains of laboratory mice despite the knowledge that environmental factors can 
modify established phenotypes of genetic mouse models. Thus, we examined the 
impact of handling on the face validity of a transgenic mouse model for the 
schizophrenia risk gene neuregulin 1 (i.e. Nrg1 type III overexpression). Nrg1 
III tg and wild type-like (WT) control mice of both sexes underwent tail or 
tunnel handling before being assessed in the open field (OF), elevated plus maze 
(EPM), social preference/novelty, prepulse inhibition, and fear conditioning 
tests. Tunnel-handling reduced the startle response in all mice, increased OF 
locomotion and exploration in males and reduced anxiety in males (OF) and 
females (EPM) compared to tail-handling. Importantly, tunnel handling induced a 
more pronounced startle response to increasing startle stimuli in Nrg1 III tg 
females compared to respective controls, a phenomenon absent in tail-handled 
females. Finally, Nrg1 III tg males displayed reduced OF exploration and centre 
locomotion and Nrg1 III tg females displayed increased cue freezing over time 
compared to controls. In conclusion, handling methods have a significant impact 
on a variety of behavioural domains thus the impact of routine handling 
procedures need be considered when testing behavioural phenotypes. Handling did 
not change the main schizophrenia-relevant characteristics of Nrg1 III tg mice 
but affected the acoustic startle-response in a genotype- and sex-specific 
manner. Future research should evaluate the effect of handling on other genetic 
models.

BACKGROUND: Thymic malignancies represent a heterogeneous group of rare thoracic 
cancers, which are classified according to the World Health Organization 
histopathologic classification, that distinguishes thymomas from thymic 
carcinomas. Data regarding the biology of those tumors are limited in the 
literature, and the vast majority have been obtained using surgical specimens 
from early-stage disease. Meanwhile, treatment of advanced, refractory thymic 
tumors currently relies on chemotherapy, with limited efficacy. Comprehensive 
genomic profiling (CGP) of advanced, refractory tumors would open some 
opportunities for innovative treatments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 and 174 consecutive patients with thymoma or 
thymic carcinoma, respectively, for whom formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
specimens from recurrent, refractory tumor were sequenced, were included. 
Sequencing was performed using hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based 
libraries to a mean coverage depth of >500× for up to 315 cancer-related genes 
plus 37 introns from 28 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.
RESULTS: Thymomas featured a low frequency of genomic alterations (average of 
1.8/tumor), and low levels of TMB. The genomic alterations identified in more 
than 10% of cases were in the CDKN2A/B and TP53 genes. Amplification in the 
NTRK1 gene was found in an unresectable, stage III, type B3 thymoma. Thymic 
carcinomas featured a significantly higher frequency of alterations at 4.0/tumor 
(P < .0001). Clinically relevant genomic alterations were observed in the 
CDKN2A, KIT, and PTEN/PI3K/MTOR pathways. Elevated TMB in thymic carcinomas was 
uncommon with only 6% of cases featuring ≥10 mutations/Mb.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort is the largest available so far, reporting on CGP of 
thymic epithelial tumors in the setting of advanced disease. The identification 
of clinically relevant genomic alterations in the KIT, PI3K, CDKN2A/B, or NTRK 
genes provides a strong rationale for potential precision medicine approaches 
using targeted agents. A subset of thymic carcinomas show high tumor mutation 
burden, what may be a predictor of efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: There has been an increasing demand for the expertise 
provided by a renal genetics clinic. Such programs are limited in the United 
States and typically operate in a genomics research setting. Here we report a 
3-year, real-world, single-center renal genetics clinic experience.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient cases referred to the renal genetics clinic 
of the Cleveland Clinic between January 2019 and March 2022 were reviewed.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Clinical and laboratory characteristics were analyzed. All 
genetic testing was performed in clinical labs.
RESULTS: 309 new patients referred from 15 specialties were evaluated, including 
118 males and 191 females aged 35.1 ± 20.3 years. Glomerular diseases were the 
leading presentation followed by cystic kidney diseases, electrolyte disorders, 
congenital anomalies of kidneys and urinary tract, nephrolithiasis, and 
tubulointerstitial kidney diseases. Dysmorphic features were noted in 27 (8.7%) 
patients. Genetic testing was recommended in 292 (94.5%) patients including 
chromosomal microarray (8.9%), single-gene tests (19.5%), multigene panels 
(77.3%), and exome sequencing (17.5%). 80.5% of patients received insurance 
coverage for genetic testing. 45% (115/256) of patients had positive results, 
25% (64/256) had variants of unknown significance, and 22.3% (57/256) had 
negative results. 43 distinct monogenic disorders were diagnosed. Family history 
of kidney disease was present in 52.8% of patients and associated with positive 
genetic findings (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.40-3.74). 69% of patients with positive 
results received a new diagnosis and/or a change in the diagnosis. Among these, 
39.7% (31/78) of patients received a significant change in disease management.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective and single-center study.
CONCLUSIONS: The renal genetics clinic plays important roles in the diagnosis 
and management of patients with genetic kidney diseases. Multigene panels are 
the most frequently used testing modality with a high diagnostic yield. Family 
history of kidney disease is a strong indication for renal genetics clinic 
referral.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine 
kinase, which plays pivotal roles in integrating growth signals on a cellular 
level. To support proliferation and survival under stress, two interacting 
complexes that harbor mTOR, mTORC1 and mTORC2, promote the transcription of 
genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenesis, enhance protein 
translation, and inhibit autophagy. Although rapamycin was originally developed 
as an inhibitor of T cell proliferation for preventing organ transplant 
rejection, its molecular target, mTOR, has been subsequently identified as a 
central regulator of metabolic cues that drive lineage specification in the 
immune system. Owing to oxidative stress, the activation of mTORC1 has emerged 
as a central pathway for the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus and 
other autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, mTORC1 has also been identified as a 
mediator of the Warburg effect that allows cell survival under hypoxia. 
Rapamycin and new classes of mTOR inhibitors are being developed to block not 
only transplant rejection and autoimmunity but also to treat obesity and various 
forms of cancer. Through preventing these diseases, personalized mTOR blockade 
holds promise to extend life span.

Valproic acid (VPA) exposure as an environmental factor that confers risk of 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), its functional mechanisms in the human brain 
remain unclear since relevant studies are currently restricted to 
two-dimensional cell cultures and animal models. To identify mechanisms by which 
VPA contribute to ASD risk in human, here we used human forebrain organoids 
(hFOs), in vitro derived three-dimensional cell cultures that recapitulate key 
human brain developmental features. We identified that VPA exposure in hFOs 
affected the expression of genes enriched in neural development, synaptic 
transmission, oxytocin signaling, calcium, and potassium signaling pathways, 
which have been implicated in ASD. Genes (e.g., CAMK4, CLCN4, DPP10, GABRB3, 
KCNB1, PRKCB, SCN1A, and SLC24A2) that affected by VPA were significantly 
overlapped with those dysregulated in brains or organoids derived from ASD 
patients, and known ASD risk genes, as well as genes in ASD risk-associated gene 
coexpression modules. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that VPA 
exposure affected the expression of genes in choroid plexus, excitatory neuron, 
immature neuron, and medial ganglionic eminence cells annotated in hFOs. 
Microelectrode array further identified that VPA exposure in hFOs disrupted 
synaptic transmission. Taken together, this study connects VPA exposure to ASD 
pathogenesis using hFOs, which is valuable for illuminating the etiology of ASD 
and screening for potential therapeutic targets.

Websites figure predominantly in everyday life. However, many websites remain 
inaccessible to autistic people, and existing efforts to improve accessibility 
are in early stages, do not directly include autistic users in their 
development, or have not been empirically evaluated. The Academic Autism 
Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) used a community-based 
participatory research approach to create a website to improve health care 
access for autistic adults. We used the creation of that website as a "living 
laboratory" to develop the AASPIRE Web Accessibility Guidelines for Autistic Web 
Users. Our guidelines are grounded in accessibility theory, had autistic 
end-user involvement at all stages, and were empirically evaluated through a 
usability study and evaluation surveys. We incorporated what we learned into the 
design of the website, and compiled the accessibility information into a set of 
guidelines. The guidelines offer recommendations for increasing the physical, 
intellectual, and social acceptability of websites for use by autistic adults. 
In the evaluation of the website by 170 autistic end users, nearly all indicated 
it was easy to use (97%), easy to understand (95%), important (97%), and useful 
(96%). Ninety-two percent would recommend it to a friend, and 95% would 
recommend it to a health care provider. There were no significant associations 
between usability or understandability and education level, receipt of help 
using the site, browser type (e.g., IE or Safari), or device type (e.g., PC or 
tablet). We recommend using the guidelines to improve website accessibility for 
autistic Internet users.
LAY SUMMARY: AASPIRE Web Accessibility Guideline: This guideline is a summary of 
the accessibility features we identified and implemented during the course of 
our study. None of these items were difficult or expensive for us to implement. 
They did not require special expertise beyond basic web programming and 
technical communications skills. We recommend that anyone seeking to create 
accessible websites for autistic users follow the Academic Autism Spectrum 
Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) Web Accessibility Guideline in 
addition to broader web and communications standards and principles.Physical 
accessibility:Provide at least one low-contrast neutral color palette option to 
accommodate sensitive vision.Provide a selection of color palettes, including 
one with a dark background and one with a light background, again to accommodate 
color and contrast sensitivity.Provide a no-style option (i.e., no cascading 
style sheets (CSS) to accommodate browser customization and users who prefer no 
stylistic formatting.Provide simple consistent navigation and highly consistent 
site behavior for increased ease of operation.Avoid textured backgrounds, moving 
images, decorative elements that do not convey information, and other visual 
and/or sonic "clutter"; these types of elements may make the site difficult or 
impossible to comprehend.Provide smaller font sizes in addition to larger ones; 
large font sizes may make the page appear cluttered and difficult to read.Use a 
plain accessible sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for ease of 
readability.Intellectual accessibility:Use the simplest interface possible for 
ease of understanding.Use simple concrete icons or images to communicate 
redundant information with text, and accommodate multiple ways of understanding 
information.Clearly label site elements with their purpose everywhere on the 
site, even if it seems redundant, to make navigation and site functionality 
easier to follow.Provide concrete examples where applicable to accommodate 
difficulties in understanding abstractions or generalizations.Minimize scrolling 
so the user does not need to rely on assumptions about content to guess what 
might be on the page.Show all important features and site navigation (as opposed 
to within combo box drop-down areas) so the user does not need to rely on 
assumptions to guess whether the item exists and how to access it. For example, 
completely visible list boxes or radio buttons can be used instead of combo 
boxes.Make content as short as possible without sacrificing precision and 
specificity, to reduce cognitive burden.Social accessibility:Be specific and 
precise in language use; avoid colloquialisms, idioms, and ambiguity to 
accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Explain the reason behind any 
nonstandard instructions or unusual information; provide additional pragmatic 
context to accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Provide 
alternatives to definitive response items on surveys and forms, for example, "do 
not know," "do not wish to say," or "not applicable," to reduce frustration for 
not being able to produce an exact answer.Use FAQ formats to organize complex 
information to enhance clarity as to why the information might be useful to the 
user and how it connects to their life.Define terms that might have different 
meanings depending on social context, or which might be jargon related to a 
specialized field (e.g., "drug interactions" and "health care providers"), to 
accommodate difficulties with language pragmatics.Be mindful of autistic culture 
and community preferences, including the language used to describe autism and 
how community-based symbols and history might influence content and perception 
of site credibility.

Chest CT is emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical management of 
COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential 
to aid in rapid evaluation of CT scans for differentiation of COVID-19 findings 
from other clinical entities. Here we show that a series of deep learning 
algorithms, trained in a diverse multinational cohort of 1280 patients to 
localize parietal pleura/lung parenchyma followed by classification of COVID-19 
pneumonia, can achieve up to 90.8% accuracy, with 84% sensitivity and 93% 
specificity, as evaluated in an independent test set (not included in training 
and validation) of 1337 patients. Normal controls included chest CTs from 
oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false positive rate 
in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non COVID-19) pneumonias was 
10%. AI-based algorithms can readily identify CT scans with COVID-19 associated 
pneumonia, as well as distinguish non-COVID related pneumonias with high 
specificity in diverse patient populations.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects 5% of children 
world-wide. Of these, two-thirds continue to have impairing symptoms of ADHD 
into adulthood. Although a large literature implicates structural brain 
differences of the disorder, it is not clear if adults with ADHD have similar 
neuroanatomical differences as those seen in children with recent reports from 
the large ENIGMA-ADHD consortium finding structural differences for children but 
not for adults. This paper uses deep learning neural network classification 
models to determine if there are neuroanatomical changes in the brains of 
children with ADHD that are also observed for adult ADHD, and vice versa. We 
found that structural MRI data can significantly separate ADHD from control 
participants for both children and adults. Consistent with the prior reports 
from ENIGMA-ADHD, prediction performance and effect sizes were better for the 
child than the adult samples. The model trained on adult samples significantly 
predicted ADHD in the child sample, suggesting that our model learned anatomical 
features that are common to ADHD in childhood and adulthood. These results 
support the continuity of ADHD's brain differences from childhood to adulthood. 
In addition, our work demonstrates a novel use of neural network classification 
models to test hypotheses about developmental continuity.

We performed a transcriptome-wide meta-analysis and gene co-expression network 
analysis to identify genes and gene networks dysregulated in the peripheral 
blood of bipolar disorder (BD) cases relative to unaffected comparison subjects, 
and determined the specificity of the transcriptomic signatures of BD and 
schizophrenia (SZ). Nineteen genes and 4 gene modules were significantly 
differentially expressed in BD cases. Thirteen gene modules were shown to be 
differentially expressed in a combined case-group of BD and SZ subjects called 
"major psychosis", including genes biologically linked to apoptosis, reactive 
oxygen, chromatin remodeling, and immune signaling. No modules were 
differentially expressed between BD and SZ cases. Machine-learning classifiers 
trained to separate diagnostic classes based solely on gene expression profiles 
could distinguish BD cases from unaffected comparison subjects with an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.724, as well as BD cases from SZ cases with 
AUC = 0.677 in withheld test samples. We introduced a novel and straightforward 
method called "polytranscript risk scoring" that could distinguish BD cases from 
unaffected subjects (AUC = 0.672) and SZ cases (AUC = 0.607) significantly 
better than expected by chance. Taken together, our results highlighted gene 
expression alterations common to BD and SZ that involve biological processes of 
inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and chromatin regulation, and 
highlight disorder-specific changes in gene expression that discriminate the 
major psychoses.

Numerous geochemical approaches have been proposed to ascertain if methane 
concentrations in groundwater, [CH4], are anomalous, i.e., migrated from 
hydrocarbon production wells, rather than derived from natural sources. We 
propose a machine-learning model to consider alkalinity, Ca, Mg, Na, Ba, Fe, Mn, 
Cl, sulfate, TDS, specific conductance, pH, temperature, and turbidity 
holistically together. The model, an ensemble of sub-models targeting one 
parameter pair per sub-model, was trained with groundwater chemistry from 
Pennsylvania (n=19,086) and a set of 16 analyses from putatively contaminated 
groundwater. For cases where [CH4] ≥ 10 mg/L, salinity- and redox-related 
parameters sometimes show that CH4 may have moved into the aquifer recently and 
separately from natural brine migration, i.e., anomalous CH4. We applied the 
model to validation and hold-out data for Pennsylvania (n=4,786) and groundwater 
data from three other gas-producing states: New York (n=203), Texas (n=688), and 
Colorado (n=10,258). The applications show that 1.4%, 1.3%, 0%, and 0.9% of 
tested samples in these four states, respectively, have high [CH4] and are ≥50% 
likely to have been impacted by gas migrated from exploited reservoirs. If our 
approach is indeed successful in flagging anomalous CH4, we conclude that: i) 
the frequency of anomalous CH4 (# flagged water samples / total samples tested) 
in the Appalachian Basin is similar in areas where gas wells target 
unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs, and ii) the frequency of 
anomalous CH4 in Pennsylvania is higher than in Texas + Colorado. We cannot, 
however, exclude the possibility that differences among regions might be 
affected by differences in data volumes. Machine learning models will become 
increasingly useful in informing decision-making for shale gas development.

There is a wide differential diagnosis within polyposis syndromes. Our case 
represents an interesting and diagnostically challenging diagnosis involving a 
41-year-old male who presented with an incidental gastric mass on imaging and a 
colonic mass seen on colonoscopy. Following multiple endoscopic evaluations, 
histological analysis, and genetic testing, the patient was ultimately diagnosed 
with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 
(HHT) despite the initial suspicion for Ménétrier's disease. His disease course 
was complicated by an acute upper extremity thrombus and diagnosis of colorectal 
carcinoma. This case highlights the importance of a thorough evaluation when 
polyposis syndromes are suspected. Prompt and accurate diagnosis can aid in the 
treatment, surveillance, and prevention of colorectal carcinoma.

Despite a wealth of evidence for the role of genetics in attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific and definitive genetic mechanisms have 
not been identified. Pathway analyses, a subset of gene-set analyses, extend the 
knowledge gained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by providing 
functional context for genetic associations. However, there are numerous methods 
for association testing of gene sets and no real consensus regarding the best 
approach. The present study applied six pathway analysis methods to identify 
pathways associated with ADHD in two GWAS datasets from the Psychiatric Genomics 
Consortium. Methods that utilize genotypes to model pathway-level effects 
identified more replicable pathway associations than methods using summary 
statistics. In addition, pathways implicated by more than one method were 
significantly more likely to replicate. A number of brain-relevant pathways, 
such as RhoA signaling, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, fibroblast growth factor 
receptor activity, and pathways containing potassium channel genes, were 
nominally significant by multiple methods in both datasets. These results 
support previous hypotheses about the role of regulation of neurotransmitter 
release, neurite outgrowth and axon guidance in contributing to the ADHD 
phenotype and suggest the value of cross-method convergence in evaluating 
pathway analysis results. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have 
distinct and overlapping genetic and clinical features.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to test the hypothesis that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) 
for asthma (PRSAsthma) and spirometry (FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity; 
PRSspiro) would demonstrate differential associations with asthma, COPD, and 
asthma-COPD overlap (ACO).
METHODS: We developed and tested 2 asthma PRSs and applied the higher performing 
PRSAsthma and a previously published PRSspiro to research (Genetic Epidemiology 
of COPD study and Childhood Asthma Management Program, with spirometry) and 
electronic health record-based (Mass General Brigham Biobank and Genetic 
Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging [GERA]) studies. We assessed the 
association of PRSs with COPD and asthma using modified random-effects and 
binary-effects meta-analyses, and ACO and asthma exacerbations in specific 
cohorts. Models were adjusted for confounders and genetic ancestry.
RESULTS: In meta-analyses of 102,477 participants, the PRSAsthma (odds ratio 
[OR] per SD, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.14-1.19]) and PRSspiro (OR per SD, 1.19 [95% CI, 
1.17-1.22]) both predicted asthma, whereas the PRSspiro predicted COPD (OR per 
SD, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21-1.30]). However, results differed by cohort. The PRSspiro 
was not associated with COPD in GERA and Mass General Brigham Biobank. In the 
Genetic Epidemiology of COPD study, the PRSAsthma (OR per SD: Whites, 1.3; 
African Americans, 1.2) and PRSspiro (OR per SD: Whites, 2.2; African Americans, 
1.6) were both associated with ACO. In GERA, the PRSAsthma was associated with 
asthma exacerbations (OR, 1.18) in Whites; the PRSspiro was associated with 
asthma exacerbations in White, LatinX, and East Asian participants.
CONCLUSIONS: PRSs for asthma and spirometry are both associated with ACO and 
asthma exacerbations. Genetic prediction performance differs in research versus 
electronic health record-based cohorts.

Genetic associations involving both rare and common alleles have been reported 
for schizophrenia but there have been no systematic scans for rare recessive 
genotypes using fully phased trio data. Here, we use exome sequencing in 604 
schizophrenia proband-parent trios to investigate the role of recessive 
(homozygous or compound heterozygous) nonsynonymous genotypes in the disorder. 
The burden of recessive genotypes was not significantly increased in probands at 
either a genome-wide level or in any individual gene after adjustment for 
multiple testing. At a system level, probands had an excess of nonsynonymous 
compound heterozygous genotypes (minor allele frequency, MAF ⩽ 1%) in 
voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs; eight in probands and none in parents, P = 
1.5 × 10(-)(4)). Previous findings of multiple de novo loss-of-function 
mutations in this gene family, particularly SCN2A, in autism and intellectual 
disability provide biological and genetic plausibility for this finding. 
Pointing further to the involvement of VGSCs in schizophrenia, we found that 
these genes were enriched for nonsynonymous mutations (MAF ⩽ 0.1%) in cases 
genotyped using an exome array, (5585 schizophrenia cases and 8103 controls), 
and that in the trios data, synaptic proteins interacting with VGSCs were also 
enriched for both compound heterozygosity (P = 0.018) and de novo mutations (P = 
0.04). However, we were unable to replicate the specific association with 
compound heterozygosity at VGSCs in an independent sample of Taiwanese 
schizophrenia trios (N = 614). We conclude that recessive genotypes do not 
appear to make a substantial contribution to schizophrenia at a genome-wide 
level. Although multiple lines of evidence, including several from this study, 
suggest that rare mutations in VGSCs contribute to the disorder, in the absence 
of replication of the original findings regarding compound heterozygosity, this 
conclusion requires evaluation in a larger sample of trios.

BACKGROUND: Early response to initial chemotherapy in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 
measured by computed tomography (CT) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) 
after two to three cycles of chemotherapy may inform therapeutic decisions. Risk 
stratification at diagnosis could, however, allow earlier and potentially more 
efficacious treatment modifications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a predictive model for event-free survival 
(EFS) in pediatric/adolescent HL using clinical data known at diagnosis from 
1103 intermediate-risk HL patients treated on Children's Oncology Group protocol 
AHOD0031 with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, 
cyclophosphamide (ABVE-PC) chemotherapy and radiation. Independent predictors of 
EFS were identified and used to develop and validate a prognostic score 
(Childhood Hodgkin International Prognostic Score [CHIPS]). A training cohort 
was randomly selected to include approximately half of the overall cohort, with 
the remainder forming the validation cohort.
RESULTS: Stage 4 disease, large mediastinal mass, albumin (<3.5), and fever were 
independent predictors of EFS that were each assigned one point in the CHIPS.  
Four-year EFS was 93.1% for patients with CHIPS = 0, 88.5% for patients with 
CHIPS = 1, 77.6% for patients with CHIPS = 2, and 69.2% for patients with CHIPS 
= 3.
CONCLUSIONS: CHIPS was highly predictive of EFS, identifying a subset (with 
CHIPS 2 or 3) that comprises 27% of intermediate-risk patients who have a 4-year 
EFS of <80% and who may benefit from early therapeutic augmentation. 
 Furthermore, CHIPS identified higher risk patients who were not identified by 
early PET or CT response. CHIPS is a robust and inexpensive approach to 
predicting risk in patients with intermediate-risk HL that may improve ability 
to tailor therapy to risk factors known at diagnosis.

The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) introduced the research 
domain criteria (RDoC) initiative to promote the integration of information 
across multiple units of analysis (i.e., brain circuits, physiology, behavior, 
self-reports) to better understand the basic dimensions of behavior and 
cognitive functioning underlying normal and abnormal mental conditions. Along 
those lines, this study examined the association between peripheral blood gene 
expression levels and emotional and behavioral problems in school-age children. 
Children were chosen from two age- and sex-matched groups: those with or without 
parental reports of any prior or current psychiatric diagnosis. RNA-sequencing 
was performed on whole blood from 96 probands aged 6-12 years who were 
medication-free at the time of assessment. Module eigengenes were derived using 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations were tested 
between module eigengene expression levels and eight syndrome scales from parent 
ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Nine out of the 36 modules were 
significantly associated with at least one syndrome scale measured by the CBCL 
(i.e., aggression, social problems, attention problems, and/or thought problems) 
after accounting for covariates and correcting for multiple testing. Our study 
demonstrates that variation in peripheral blood gene expression relates to 
emotional and behavioral profiles in children. If replicated and validated, our 
results may help in identifying problem or at-risk behavior in pediatric 
populations, and in elucidating the biological pathways that modulate complex 
human behavior.

We examined a large dataset of female metastatic breast cancers (MBCs) profiled 
with comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to identify the prevalence and 
distribution of immunotherapy responsiveness-associated biomarkers. DNA was 
extracted from 3831 consecutive MBCs: 1237 (ERpos /HER2neg ), 1953 ERneg 
/HER2amp , and 641 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). CGP was performed using 
the FoundationOne® or FoundationOne® CDx NGS assay. Tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) were determined in a subset of cases. 
PD-L1 expression in immunocytes in a subset of cases was determined by 
immunohistochemistry using the companion diagnostic VENTANA PD-L1 SP142 Assay. 
The median age of the cohort was 54 years (range 20-89). Genomic alterations 
(GAs)/tumor were similar (range: 5.9-7.3). Markers of potential immune 
checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) benefit included: CD274 (PD-L1) amplification 
(1%-3%), BRAF GA (1%-4%), TMB of ≥10 mutations/Mb (8%-12%), MSI-high 
(0.1%-0.4%), PBRM1 GA (1%), and positive PD-L1 staining of immunocytes ranging 
from 13% in ERpos /HER2neg and 33% in ERneg /HER2amp to 47% in the TNBC group. 
Potential markers of ICPI resistance included inactivating STK11 GA (1%-2%) and 
MDM2 amplification (3%-6%). MTOR pathway targets were common with lowest 
frequency in TNBC. ERBB2 short variant mutations were most frequent ERpos 
/HER2neg and absent in TNBC. BRCA1/2 GA were least frequent in ERneg /HER2amp . 
The demonstrations of clinical benefit of immunotherapy in MBC support the need 
for development and utilization of biomarkers to guide the use of ICPIs for 
these patients. In addition to guiding therapy selection, CGP shows potential to 
identify GA linked to response and resistance to ICPI in MBC.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have shown clinical outcomes data that support the 
use of CD274 (PD-L1) copy-number (CN) gains and/or losses as a biomarker for 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI). Here, we present the landscape of CD274 CN 
changes across a large cohort of solid tumor cases and correlate these with 
PD-L1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry.
METHODS: We analyzed all cases that underwent comprehensive genomic profiling 
(CGP) testing at Foundation Medicine between August 2014 and June 2020. CD274 CN 
changes were correlated with PD-L1 expression in tumor types where there were 
Food and Drug Administration approved companion diagnostic (CDx) claims and the 
CDx assay was used to assess PD-L1 expression.
RESULTS: In all, 244 584 samples representing 290 solid tumor types were 
included in the study. Overall, 17.6% (42 983/244 584) had CD274 CN gains 
(>specimen ploidy), 44.6% (108 970/244 584) were CD274 CN neutral, and 37.9% (92 
631/244 584) had CD274 CN loss. Using different CN cut offs to define CD274 
positivity resulted in different prevalence estimates: ploidy +1, 17.4% (42 
636/244 584); ploidy +2, 6.2% (15 183/244 584); ploidy +3, 2.2% (5375/244 584); 
ploidy +4, 1.1% (2712/244 584); and ploidy +8, 0.2% (434/244 584). The 
prevalence of CN changes and CN positivity varied based on tumor type. CD274 CN 
gains were significantly associated with PD-L1 positivity in NSCLC, urothelial 
carcinoma, breast carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, esophagus squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) and head and neck SCC (ORs 3.3, 3.0, 2.0, 4.5. 3.8, 8.4, 1.4, 
respectively; p<0.05) and with microsatellite instability status in only 
clinically relevant tumor types (gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal 
adenocarcinoma, uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma 
and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (OR: 5.2, 1.9, 3.2, 3.7 and 6.5, 
respectively; p<0.05)). Conversely, CD274 CN changes were not significantly 
correlated with tumor mutational burden in almost all the tumor types.
CONCLUSION: CD274 CN changes and PD-L1 expression were highly correlated in 
multiple tumor types. These prevalence data on CD274 CN changes across a large

OBJECTIVE: Some studies have suggested alterations of structural brain asymmetry 
in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but findings have been 
contradictory and based on small samples. Here, we performed the largest ever 
analysis of brain left-right asymmetry in ADHD, using 39 datasets of the ENIGMA 
consortium.
METHODS: We analyzed asymmetry of subcortical and cerebral cortical structures 
in up to 1,933 people with ADHD and 1,829 unaffected controls. Asymmetry Indexes 
(AIs) were calculated per participant for each bilaterally paired measure, and 
linear mixed effects modeling was applied separately in children, adolescents, 
adults, and the total sample, to test exhaustively for potential associations of 
ADHD with structural brain asymmetries.
RESULTS: There was no evidence for altered caudate nucleus asymmetry in ADHD, in 
contrast to prior literature. In children, there was less rightward asymmetry of 
the total hemispheric surface area compared to controls (t = 2.1, p = .04). 
Lower rightward asymmetry of medial orbitofrontal cortex surface area in ADHD 
(t = 2.7, p = .01) was similar to a recent finding for autism spectrum disorder. 
There were also some differences in cortical thickness asymmetry across age 
groups. In adults with ADHD, globus pallidus asymmetry was altered compared to 
those without ADHD. However, all effects were small (Cohen's d from -0.18 to 
0.18) and would not survive study-wide correction for multiple testing.
CONCLUSION: Prior studies of altered structural brain asymmetry in ADHD were 
likely underpowered to detect the small effects reported here. Altered 
structural asymmetry is unlikely to provide a useful biomarker for ADHD, but may 
provide neurobiological insights into the trait.

Diagnostic exome sequencing has recently emerged as an invaluable tool in 
determining the molecular etiology of cases involving dysmorphism and 
developmental delay that are otherwise unexplained by more traditional methods 
of genetic testing. Our patient was large for gestational age at 35 weeks, 
delivered to a 27-year-old primigravid Caucasian whose pregnancy was complicated 
by preeclampsia. Neonatal period was notable for hypoglycemia, apnea, 
bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, grade I intraventricular hemorrhage, subdural 
hematoma, laryngomalacia, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. The patient had 
numerous minor dysmorphic features. At three and a half years of age, she has 
global developmental delays and nystagmus, and is being followed for a 
mediastinal neuroblastoma that is currently in remission. Karyotype and 
oligo-microarray were normal. Whole-exome, next generation sequencing (NGS) 
coupled to bioinformatic filtering and expert medical review at Ambry Genetics 
revealed 14 mutations in 9 genes, and these genes underwent medical review. A 
heterozygous de novo frameshift mutation, c.2737_2738dupGA p.D913Efs*59, in 
which two nucleotides are duplicated in exon 17 of the CLTC gene, results in 
substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at position 913 of the protein, 
as well as a frame shift that results in a premature termination codon situated 
58 amino acids downstream. Clathrin Heavy Chain 1 (CHC1) has been shown to play 
an important role in the brain for vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter 
release at pre-synaptic nerve terminals. There is also evidence implicating it 
in the proper development of the placenta during the early stages of pregnancy. 
The CLTC alteration identified herein is likely to provide an explanation for 
the patient's adverse phenotype. Ongoing functional studies will further define 
the impact of this alteration on CHC1 function and consequently, human disease.

OBJECTIVE: ADHD youth show poor oculomotor control. Recent research shows that 
attention-related eye vergence is weak in ADHD children.
METHOD: To validate vergence as a marker to classify ADHD, we assessed the 
modulation in the angle of vergence of children ( n = 43) previously diagnosed 
with ADHD while performing an attention task and compared the results with 
age-matched clinical controls ( n = 19) and healthy peers ( n = 30).
RESULTS: We observed strong vergence responses in healthy participants and weak 
vergence in the clinical controls. ADHD children showed no significant vergence 
responses. Machine-learning models classified ADHD patients ( n = 21) from 
healthy controls ( n = 21) with an accuracy of 96.3% (false positive [FP]: 
5.12%; false negative [FN]: 0%; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.99) and ADHD 
children ( n = 11) from clinical controls ( n = 14) with an accuracy of 85.7% 
(FP: 4.5%; FN: 19.2%, AUC: 0.90).
CONCLUSION: In combination with an attention task, vergence responses can be 
used as an objective marker to detect ADHD in children.

Biological research and clinical management in psychiatry face two major 
impediments: the high degree of overlap in psychopathology between diagnoses and 
the inherent heterogeneity with regard to severity. Here, we aim to stratify 
cases into homogeneous transdiagnostic subgroups using psychometric information 
with the ultimate aim of identifying individuals with higher risk for severe 
illness. 397 participants of the PsyCourse study with schizophrenia- or 
bipolar-spectrum diagnoses were prospectively phenotyped over 18 months. Factor 
analysis of mixed data of different rating scales and subsequent longitudinal 
clustering were used to cluster disease trajectories. Five clusters of 
longitudinal trajectories were identified in the psychopathologic dimensions. 
Clusters differed significantly with regard to Global Assessment of Functioning, 
disease course, and-in some cases-diagnosis while there were no significant 
differences regarding sex, age at baseline or onset, duration of illness, or 
polygenic burden for schizophrenia. Longitudinal clustering may aid in 
identifying transdiagnostic homogeneous subgroups of individuals with severe 
psychiatric disease.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the utility of novel 
verbal fluency scores for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHOD: Verbal fluency lists (animals, vegetables, F, A, and S) from 107 MCI 
patients and 51 cognitively normal controls were transcribed into electronic 
text files and automatically scored with traditional raw scores and five types 
of novel scores computed using methods from machine learning and natural 
language processing. Additional scores were derived from structural MRI scans: 
region of interest measures of hippocampal and ventricular volumes and gray 
matter scores derived from performing ICA on measures of cortical thickness. 
Over 4 years of follow-up, 24 MCI patients converted to AD. Using conversion as 
the outcome variable, ensemble classifiers were constructed by training 
classifiers on the individual groups of scores and then entering predictions 
from the primary classifiers into regularized logistic regression models. 
Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the 
curve (AUC) was measured for classifiers trained with five groups of available 
variables.
RESULTS: Classifiers trained with novel scores outperformed those trained with 
raw scores (AUC 0.872 vs 0.735; P < .05 by DeLong test). Addition of structural 
brain measurements did not improve performance based on novel scores alone.
CONCLUSION: The brevity and cost profile of verbal fluency tasks recommends 
their use for clinical decision making. The word lists generated are a rich 
source of information for predicting outcomes in MCI. Further work is needed to 
assess the utility of verbal fluency for early AD.

In nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, grade drives important treatment and 
management decisions. However, grading is complex and qualitative, and it has 
considerable interobserver and intraobserver variability. Previous literature 
showed that nuclear features quantitatively differ between bladder cancer 
grades, but these studies were limited in size and scope. In this study, we 
aimed to measure morphometric features relevant to grading criteria and build 
simplified classification models that objectively distinguish between the grades 
of noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (NPUC). We analyzed 516 low-grade 
and 125 high-grade 1.0-mm diameter image samples from a cohort of 371 NPUC 
cases. All images underwent World Health Organization/International Society of 
Urological Pathology 2004 consensus pathologist grading at our institution that 
was subsequently validated by expert genitourinary pathologists from 2 
additional institutions. Automated software segmented the tissue regions and 
measured the nuclear features of size, shape, and mitotic rate for millions of 
nuclei. Then, we analyzed differences between grades and constructed 
classification models, which had accuracies up to 88% and areas under the curve 
as high as 0.94. Variation in the nuclear area was the best univariate 
discriminator and was prioritized, along with the mitotic index, in the 
top-performing classifiers. Adding shape-related variables improved accuracy 
further. These findings indicate that nuclear morphometry and automated mitotic 
figure counts can be used to objectively differentiate between grades of NPUC. 
Future efforts will adapt the workflow to whole slides and tune grading 
thresholds to best reflect time to recurrence and progression. Defining these 
essential quantitative elements of grading has the potential to revolutionize 
pathologic assessment and provide a starting point from which to improve the 
prognostic utility of grade.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with aberrant expression of 
multiple genes. However, identifying its exact causal genes remains a 
considerable challenge. The brain-specific transcription factor POU3F2 (POU 
domain, class 3, transcription factor 2) has been recognized as a risk factor 
for SCZ, but our understanding of its target genes and pathogenic mechanisms are 
still limited. Here we report that POU3F2 regulates 42 SCZ-related genes in 
knockdown and RNA-sequencing experiments of human neural progenitor cells 
(NPCs). Among those SCZ-related genes, TRIM8 (Tripartite motif containing 8) is 
located in SCZ-associated genetic locus and is aberrantly expressed in patients 
with SCZ. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) 
showed that POU3F2 induces TRIM8 expression by binding to the SCZ-associated SNP 
(single nucleotide polymorphism) rs5011218, which affects POU3F2-binding 
efficiency at the promoter region of TRIM8. We investigated the cellular 
functions of POU3F2 and TRIM8 as they co-regulate several pathways related to 
neural development and synaptic function. Knocking down either POU3F2 or TRIM8 
promoted the proliferation of NPCs, inhibited their neuronal differentiation, 
and impaired the excitatory synaptic transmission of NPC-derived neurons. These 
results indicate that POU3F2 regulates TRIM8 expression through the 
SCZ-associated SNP rs5011218, and both genes may be involved in the etiology of 
SCZ by regulating neural development and synaptic function.

PURPOSE: Combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is a rare, 
aggressive primary liver carcinoma, with morphologic features of both 
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and liver cholangiocarcinomas (CCA).
METHODS: The genomic profiles of 4,975 CCA, 1,470 HCC, and 73 cHCC-CCA cases 
arising from comprehensive genomic profiling in the course of clinical care were 
reviewed for genomic alterations (GA), tumor mutational burden, microsatellite 
instability status, genomic loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal aneuploidy, 
genomic ancestry, and hepatitis B virus status.
RESULTS: In cHCC-CCA, GA were most common in TP53 (65.8%), TERT (49.3%), and 
PTEN (9.6%), and 24.6% cHCC-CCA harbored potentially targetable GA. Other GA 
were predominantly associated with either HCC or CCA, including, but not limited 
to, TERT, FGFR2, IDH1, and presence of hepatitis B virus. On the basis of these 
features, a machine learning (ML) model was trained to classify a cHCC-CCA case 
as CCA-like or HCC-like. Of cHCC-CCA cases, 16% (12/73) were ML-classified as 
CCA-like and 58% (42/73) cHCC-CCA were ML-classified as HCC-like. The ML model 
classified more than 70% of cHCC-CCA as CCA-like or HCC-like on the basis of 
genomic profiles, without additional clinico-pathologic input.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the use of ML for classification as based 
on a targeted exome panel used during routine clinical care. Classification of 
cHCC-CCA by genomic features alone creates insights into the biology of the 
disease and warrants further investigation for relevance to clinical care.

Infants are screened for cystic fibrosis (CF) in New York State (NYS) using an 
IRT-DNA algorithm. The purpose of this study was to validate and assess clinical 
validity of the US FDA-cleared Illumina MiSeqDx CF 139-Variant Assay (139-VA) in 
the diverse NYS CF population. The study included 439 infants with CF identified 
via newborn screening (NBS) from 2002 to 2012. All had been screened using the 
Abbott Molecular CF Genotyping Assay or the Hologic InPlex CF Molecular Test. 
All with CF and zero or one mutation were tested using the 139-VA. DNA extracted 
from dried blood spots was reliably and accurately genotyped using the 139-VA. 
Sixty-three additional mutations were identified. Clinical sensitivity of three 
panels ranged from 76.2% (23 mutations recommended for screening by ACMG/ACOG) 
to 79.7% (current NYS 39-mutation InPlex panel), up to 86.0% for the 139-VA. For 
all, sensitivity was highest in Whites and lowest in the Black population. 
Although the sample size was small, there was a nearly 20% increase in 
sensitivity for the Black CF population using the 139-VA (68.2%) over the 
ACMG/ACOG and InPlex panels (both 50.0%). Overall, the 139-VA is more sensitive 
than other commercially available panels, and could be considered for NBS, 
clinical, or research laboratories conducting CF screening.
