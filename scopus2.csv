Typically, these datasets contain more genomic features than samples, limiting the use of multivariable statistical and machine learning-based approaches to analysis. Therefore, effective alternative approaches are urgently needed to identify features-of-interest in ‘-omics’ data. In this study, we present the molecular feature selection tool, a novel, ensemble-based, feature selection application for identifying candidate biomarkers in ‘-omics’ data. As proof-of-principle, we applied the molecular feature selection tool to identify a small set of immune-related genes as potential biomarkers of three prostate adenocarcinoma subtypes. Furthermore, we tested the selected genes in a model to classify the three subtypes and compared the results to models built using all genes and all differentially expressed genes. Genes identified with the molecular feature selection tool performed better than the other models in this study in all comparison metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using a significantly smaller set of genes. In addition, we developed a simple graphical user interface for the molecular feature selection tool, which is available for free download. This user-friendly interface is a valuable tool for the identification of potential biomarkers in gene expression datasets and is an asset for biomarker discovery studies. © 2022 by the authors.","K.

CFS formation can be induced in vitro by mild level of DNA replication stress, such as DNA polymerase inhibition or nucleotide pool disturbance. The mechanisms of CFS formation have been linked to DNA replication timing control, transcription activities, as well as chromatin organization. However, it is unclear what specific cis- or trans-factors regulate the interplay between replication and transcription that determine CFS formation. We recently reported genome-wide mapping of DNA DSBs under replication stress induced by aphidicolin in human lymphoblastoids for the first time. Here, we systematically compared these DSBs with regards to nearby epigenomic features mapped in the same cell line from published studies. We demonstrate that aphidicolin-induced DSBs are strongly correlated with histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation, a marker for active transcription. We further demonstrate that this DSB signature is a composite effect by the dual treatment of aphidicolin and its solvent, dimethylsulfoxide, the latter of which potently induces transcription on its own. We also present complementing evidence for the association between DSBs and 3D chromosome architectural domains with high density gene cluster and active transcription. Additionally, we show that while DSBs were detected at all but one of the fourteen finely mapped CFSs, they were not enriched in the CFS core sequences and rather demarcated the CFS core region. Related to this point, DSB density was not higher in large genes of greater than 300 kb, contrary to reported enrichment of CFS sites at these large genes. Finally, replication timing analyses demonstrate that the CFS core region contain initiation events, suggesting that altered replication dynamics are responsible for CFS formation in relatively higher level of replication stress.

Most of the literature focuses on handling missing data in randomized controlled trials, which are not necessarily always the data used in health economics and outcomes research. Objectives: We aimed to provide an overview on missing data issues and how to address incomplete data and report the findings of a systematic literature review of methods used to deal with missing data in health economics and outcomes research studies that focused on cost, utility, and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of papers published in English language until the end of the year 2020 was carried out in PubMed. Studies using statistical methods to handle missing data for analyses of cost, utility, or patient-reported outcome data were included, as were reviews and guidance papers on handling missing data for those outcomes. The data extraction was conducted with a focus on the context of the study, the type of missing data, and the methods used to tackle missing data. Results: From 1433 identified records, 40 papers were included. Thirteen studies were economic evaluations. Thirty studies used multiple imputation with 17 studies using multiple imputation by chained equation, while 15 studies used a complete-case analysis. Seventeen studies addressed missing cost data and 23 studies dealt with missing outcome data. Eleven studies reported a single method while 20 studies used multiple methods to address missing data. Conclusions: Several health economics and outcomes research studies did not offer a justification of their approach of handling missing data and some used only a single method without a sensitivity analysis. This systematic literature review highlights the importance of considering the missingness mechanism and including sensitivity analyses when planning, analyzing, and reporting health economics and outcomes research studies. © 2023, The Author(s).","G.L.

Therefore, many attempts were devoted to improve explicit comprehension strategy instruction at different school levels and fields including EFL and ESL. Despite these efforts, explicit comprehension instruction is still drought and far from satisfactory. Additionally, a great deal of teachers and educators are still struggling to find the appropriate ways to explicitly and effectively teach comprehension strategies. Consequently, the purpose of the present study was to explore the general perceptions and experiences of elementary English language teachers in using children's picture books to initiate explicit comprehension strategy instruction. In order to obtain naturalistic and in-depth understanding of participating teachers' perceptions, structured classroom observations were carried out for four weeks. Findings indicated that in about 718 minutes of instruction of both classrooms, 603 minutes were allotted for explicit comprehension strategy instruction. Despite some flaws in time management, the use of only one resource to collect data, and the focus on only comprehension strategy instruction, this study could contribute to the body of research of comprehension strategy instruction in language learning classrooms.","A.

It poses a significant public health problem and contributes to rising health care costs, affecting people’s quality of life and ability to work. Previous research showed that nontreatment and undertreatment of patients with psoriasis remain a significant problem. Perspectives of patients toward seeking psoriasis treatment are understudied. Social media offers a new data source of user-generated content. Researchers suggested that the social network Twitter may serve as a rich avenue for exploring how patients communicate about their health issues. Objective: The objective of this study is to conduct a content analysis of Twitter posts (in English) published by users in the United States between February 1, 2016, and October 31, 2018, to examine perspectives that potentially influence the treatment decision among patients with psoriasis. Methods: User-generated Twitter posts that include keywords related to psoriasis will be analyzed using text classifiers to identify themes related to the research questions. We will use Symplur Signals, a health care social media analytics platform, to access the Twitter data. We will use descriptive statistics to analyze the data and identify the most prevalent topics in the Twitter content among people with psoriasis. Results: This study is supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Science through a Clinical and Translational Science Award award. Study approval was obtained from the institutional review board at the University of Southern California. Data extraction and cleaning are complete. For the time period from February 1, 2016, to October 31, 2018, we obtained 95,040 Twitter posts containing terms related to “psoriasis” from users in the United States published in English. After removing duplicates, retweets, and non-English tweets, we found that 75.51% (52,301/69,264) of the psoriasis-related posts were sent by commercial or bot-like accounts, while 16,963 posts were noncommercial and will be included in the analysis to assess the patient perspective. Analysis was completed in Summer 2020. Conclusions: This protocol paper provides a detailed description of a social media research project including the process of data extraction, cleaning, and analysis. It is our goal to contribute to the development of more transparent social media research efforts. Our findings will shed light on whether Twitter provides a promising data source for garnering patient perspective data about psoriasis treatment decisions. The data will also help to determine whether Twitter might serve as a potential outreach platform for raising awareness of psoriasis and treatment options among patients and implementing related health interventions. © Katja Reuter, Delphine Lee.","K.

Identifying fecal contaminant sources, as well as the factors that affect their transport, storage, and decay, is essential for protecting human health. However, identifying these factors is often difficult when using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) because FIB levels in surface water are often the product of multiple contaminant sources. In contrast, microbial source-tracking (MST) techniques allow not only the identification of predominant contaminant sources but also the quantification of factors affecting the transport, storage, and decay of fecal contaminants from specific hosts. We visited 68 streams in the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York, United States, between April and October 2018 and collected water quality data (i.e., Escherichia coli, MST markers, and physical–chemical parameters) and weather and land-use data, as well as data on other stream features (e.g., stream bed composition), to identify factors that were associated with fecal contamination at a regional scale. We then applied both generalized linear mixed models and conditional inference trees to identify factors and combinations of factors that were significantly associated with human and ruminant fecal contamination. We found that human contaminants were more likely to be identified when the developed area within the 60 m stream buffer exceeded 3.4%, the total developed area in the watershed exceeded 41%, or if stormwater outfalls were present immediately upstream of the sampling site. When these features were not present, human MST markers were more likely to be found when rainfall during the preceding day exceeded 1.5 cm. The presence of upstream campgrounds was also significantly associated with human MST marker detection. In addition to rainfall and water quality parameters associated with rainfall (e.g., turbidity), the minimum distance to upstream cattle operations, the proportion of the 60 m buffer used for cropland, and the presence of submerged aquatic vegetation at the sampling site were all associated based on univariable regression with elevated levels of ruminant markers. The identification of specific features associated with host-specific fecal contaminants may support the development of broader recommendations or policies aimed at reducing levels of aquatic fecal contamination. © Copyright © 2021 Green, Wilder, Wiedmann and Weller.","H.

There are two different modes of microbiome differential abundance analysis: the individual-based univariate differential abundance analysis and the group-based multivariate differential abundance analysis. The univariate analysis identifies differentially abundant microbiome taxa subject to multiple correction under certain statistical error measurements such as false discovery rate, which is typically complicated by the high-dimensionality of taxa and complex correlation structure among taxa. The multivariate analysis evaluates the overall shift in the abundance of microbiome composition between two conditions, which provides useful preliminary differential information for the necessity of followup validation studies. In this paper, we present a novel Adaptive multivariate two-sample test for Microbiome Differential Analysis (AMDA) to examine whether the composition of a taxa-set are different between two conditions. Our simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that the AMDA test was often more powerful than several competing methods while preserving the correct type I error rate.

Millions who suffer from addiction, psychosis, depression and suicidality are either untreated or inadequately treated and organized psychiatry is unable to reach them. Possibly as reflection of under-treatment of psychiatric disorders, the rates of suicide have risen: from 1999 through 2014, the age-adjusted suicide rate in the US increased 24%, from 10.5 to 13.0 per 100,000. Assessment of psychiatric symptoms in ongoing outpatient settings is costly, inadequate and unable to detect clinical changes over time. One’s digital phenotype is assessed through footprints left over as result of our interface with technology, including automated assessments of quantity and quality of social media activity, patterns and speed of device usage, and physiological data that is automatically collected, such as location, quantity and type of movement, heart rate, and sleep patterns. The use of digital footprints has been advocated for large-scale data collection that can facilitate psychiatric research in naturalistic settings. We highlight recent papers in Discover Mental Health addressing digital approaches to mental health and we also advance here the concept that digital footprints are ready for clinical use. However, before that happens there needs to be discussion on the appropriate boundaries between care that is driven by signals from digital footprints and the rights to privacy and self-determination. © 2023, The Author(s).","J.

Empirical data on detailed weekly meeting minutes over 18 weeks and the planned and actual starting and finish times of 475 activities were collected from a bridge construction case project. The information theory approach was utilized to measure the information gained from discussions pertaining to the OPDCA cycle during weekly planning meetings. Cooperative game theory and the Shapley notation of fairness were used to compute the contribution of each OPDCA step to workflow reliability. Results showed that “Observe”, “Plan”, “Do”, “Check”, and “reAct”, contributed 18%, 23%, 23%, 24%, and 12% to observed variations in workflow reliability measured by the percent plan complete (PPC). Also, findings revealed that synergy exists between the “Check” step and other steps in the OPDCA cycle. The methodology developed in this paper has potential implications for engineering managers. The method can be generalized to help project managers find the balance between planning and control efforts to improve workflow. It also provides proven techniques for continuous improvement during project execution to facilitate project success. Furthermore, at the organizational level, the developed method can help higher-level managers make informed investment decisions for employees’ training and development to improve performance in future projects. © 2023 by the authors.","M.

Modern data complements event counts with many additional measurements (such as geographic, demographic, and others) that comprise high-dimensional covariates. This leads to an important challenge to detect a change that only occurs within a region, initially unspecified, defined by these covariates. Current methods used to handle covariate information are limited to low-dimensional data. The approach presented in this article transforms the problem to supervised learning, so that an appropriate learner and signal criteria can then be defined. A feature selection algorithm is used to identify covariates that contribute to a model (either individually or through interactions) and this is used to generate a signal based on formal statistical inference. A measure of statistical significance is also included to control false alarms. Graphical plots are used to isolate change locations in covariate space.

One of the critical issues in performing breast-conserving surgery is trying to achieve microscopically clear surgical margins while maintaining excellent cosmesis. Unfortunately, unacceptably close or positive surgical margins occur in at least 20-25% of all patients undergoing BCT requiring repeat surgical excision days or weeks later, as permanent histopathology routinely takes days to complete. Our aim is to develop a better method for intraoperative imaging of non-palpable breast malignancies excised by wire or needle localization. Providing non-deformed three dimensional imaging of the excised breast tissue should allow more accurate assessment of tumor margins and consequently allow further excision at the time of initial surgery thus limiting the enormous financial and emotional burden of additional surgery. We have designed and constructed a device that allows preservation of the excised breast tissue in its natural anatomic position relative to the breast as it is imaged to assess adequate excision. We performed initial tests with needle-guided lumpectomy specimens using micro-CT and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Our device consists of a plastic sphere inside a cylindrical holder. The surgeon inserts a freshly excised piece of breast tissue into the sphere and matches its anatomic orientation with the fiducial markers on the sphere. A custom-shaped foam is placed inside the sphere to prevent specimen deformation due to gravity. DBT followed by micro-CT images of the specimen were obtained. We confirmed that our device preserved spatial orientation of the excised breast tissue and that the location error was lower than 10mm and 10 degrees.

This paper presents a manufacturing postponement framework concerted with an ensemble forecasting method based on multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory networks combined with a bagging approach to predict highly fluctuating non-stationary printed circuit boards demand data in a business offering electronics manufacturing services to the automotive industry. The devised postponement framework effectively addresses the impending modifications required by the company to cope with the shortage of semiconductors. When the proposed forecasting method is embedded with the postponement framework, the procedure is called the Postponement Bagged Long Short-Term Memory (POST-BaLSTM) model. The approach aims to optimize semiconductor use, minimize wastage, and facilitate effective resource planning. The proposed method automatically fits the forecasts into the postponement structure by considering several Long Short-Term Memory models previously optimized using hyperparameters grid search. Bagged point forecasts and prediction intervals are derived using model estimates of quantile calculations. In our implementation, we demonstrate that a two-layered archetype using our method can lead to nearly a 43% improvement in measuring forecast errors compared to statistical and machine learning methods. Moreover, our approach bestows a 75% rating interval accuracy when measured with the denoted Spectrum Fidelity assessment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","M.

Urban agriculture projects can increase access to fresh food, improve mental health and nutrition, and empower and bring communities together. We investigated the distribution of urban agriculture in Glasgow and found that the current configuration of urban agriculture projects is mostly located centrally in the city, covering 36 % of the total population (approximately 635,000) within 10-minute walking distance. We also found a positive correlation (r = 0.13, p = 0.0003) between the walking travel time to the nearest urban agriculture project and the food desert status. To increase urban agriculture access across the city, we used the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model to optimally situate new urban agriculture projects on vacant and derelict land to maximize the covered population. We identified that a minimum of 15 new urban agriculture projects could increase the population coverage to 49 % and equalize the access disparity to a statistically non-significant level. This research shows that converting vacant and derelict land in Glasgow into urban agriculture projects could both help with the city's problem of vacant and derelict land and bring many potential benefits to local communities. © 2023","Z.

We examined the effect of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in schools on standardized test scores, accounting for individual and community-level sociodemographic factors. We explored data from a Colorado school district which included individual student achievement metrics (reading and math test scores), and IEQ characteristics of school buildings measured by Operation Report Card scores (ORC). We estimated associations between ORC increase and changes in test scores using mean-based and quantile regression (QR) models, and examined heterogeneity of associations within sex and racial/ethnic subgroups. Confounder-adjusted QR models revealed differences across test distributions suggesting overall that improved IEQ may mitigate negative effects on academic achievement among students who experience social and economic risks. For example, a one unit increase in ORC for Latinx students was associated with up to a 2.7% (95%CI: 0.4%, 5.1%) increase in math score at the 90th percentile of the score distribution but a 0.4% (95%CI: 3.1%, 2.2%) decrease at the same percentile for White students. Our observations provide evidence not only on the overall importance of school IEQ on academic achievement, but also suggests a greater vulnerability or response to improved IEQ among socioeconomically disadvantaged students. © 2021","S.

Long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposons are a type of inherited polymorphic variant that may be associated with risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We performed REBELseq, a genome wide assay for L1 sequences, on DNA from male and female persons with schizophrenia and controls (n = 63 each) to identify inherited L1 insertions and validated priority insertions. L1 insertions of interest were genotyped in DNA from a replication cohort of persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and controls (n = 2268 each) to examine differences in carrier frequencies. We identified an inherited L1 insertion in ARHGAP24 and a quadallelic SNP (rs74169643) inside an L1 insertion in SNTG2 that are associated with risk for developing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (all odds ratios 1.2). Pathway analysis identified 15 gene ontologies that were differentially affected by L1 burden, including multiple ontologies related to glutamatergic signaling and immune function, which have been previously associated with schizophrenia. These findings provide further evidence supporting the role of inherited repetitive genetic elements in the heritability of psychiatric disorders.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Method: This was an international cohort study of patients undergoing elective resection of colon or rectal cancer without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID-19 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS-CoV-2 and a comparison with prepandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data. Results: From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. Thirty-day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 was 3.8% (78/2073) and the anastomotic leak rate was 4.9% (86/1738). Mortality was lowest in patients without a leak or SARS-CoV-2 (14/1601, 0.9%) and highest in patients with both a leak and SARS-CoV-2 (5/13, 38.5%). Mortality was independently associated with anastomotic leak (adjusted odds ratio 6.01, 95% confidence interval 2.58–14.06), postoperative SARS-CoV-2 (16.90, 7.86–36.38), male sex (2.46, 1.01–5.93), age >70 years (2.87, 1.32–6.20) and advanced cancer stage (3.43, 1.16–10.21). Compared with prepandemic data, there were fewer anastomotic leaks (4.9% versus 7.7%) and an overall shorter length of stay (6 versus 7 days) but higher mortality (1.7% versus 1.1%). Conclusion: Surgeons need to further mitigate against both SARS-CoV-2 and anastomotic leak when offering surgery during current and future COVID-19 waves based on patient, operative and organizational risks. © 2020 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland","A.

One of the compounds, K306, represents the most potent agonist identified to date. We find that K306 exhibits selectivity for SHIP1 vs. the paralog enzyme SHIP2, and this activation does not require the C2 domain of SHIP1 which other known SHIP1 agonists require. Thus, K306 represents a new class of SHIP1 agonists with a novel mode of agonism. Importantly, we find that K306 can suppress induction of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in macrophages or microglia, but not by their SHIP1-deficient counterparts. K306 also reduces TNF-α production in vivo in an LPS-induced endotoxemia assay. Finally, we show that K306 enhances phagolysosomal degradation of synaptosomes and dead neurons by microglia revealing a novel function for SHIP1 that might be exploited therapeutically in dementia. © 2022 The Author(s)","R.C.

These novel transcripts could have crucial functions in different biological processes and might be related to challenging diseases and pathogenesis. However, whether these genes should be classified as protein coding RNAs (pcRNAs) or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is still debated and unclear. In this study we propose a coding potential classification framework based on deep neural networks and novel features from RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data to classify RNAs transcripts into protein coding and long non coding. As far as we know, this is the first method that uses RNA-seq and Ribo-seq as predictors to classify RNAs using a deep neural network model. Compared to other methods, the prediction of our method reached 97.4% accuracy. © 2023 IEEE.","A.

Pain and anxiety are common accompaniments of surgery, and opioids have been the mainstay of pain management for decades. However, opioid abuse and addiction now place the US in an 'opioid epidemic,' with one in 16 surgical patients prescribed opioids becoming a long-Term user. To mitigate surgical pain and anxiety, we developed a virtual reality experience based on Attention Restoration Theory and affective computing techniques to deliver adaptive content based on the user's heart rate variability biofeedback. A randomized control study among 12 patients undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty at Pate wood Memorial Hospital, Greenville, SC demonstrated that patients in the VR group reported a 29.6% and 31.2% decrease in surgical pain and anxiety, respectively, compared to a control group.  © 2020 IEEE.","","Fortino G.; Wang F.-Y.; Nurnberger A.; Kaber D.; Falcone R.; Mendonca D.; Yu Z.; Guerrieri A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172815871-6","","","English","Proc.

Despite the continuous development of medical technology in recent years, its morbidity and mortality are still high. This is mainly related to the delay in starting treatment and non-adherence of clinical guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an evolving field in medicine, which has been used to develop a variety of innovative Clinical Decision Support Systems. It has shown great potential in predicting the clinical condition of patients and assisting in clinical decision-making. AI-derived algorithms can be applied to multiple stages of sepsis, such as early prediction, prognosis assessment, mortality prediction, and optimal management. This review describes the latest literature on AI for clinical decision support in sepsis, and outlines the application of AI in the prediction, diagnosis, subphenotyping, prognosis assessment, and clinical management of sepsis. In addition, we discussed the challenges of implementing and accepting this non-traditional methodology for clinical purposes. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Du, Gu and Wei.","X.

Our objectives were to establish machine learning-based methods for predicting surgeon caseload for nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using our validated hydrogel-based simulation platform and identify potential metrics of surgical expertise.Methods:Video, robotic kinematics, and force sensor data were collected from 35 board-certified urologists at the 2022 AUA conference. Video was annotated for surgical gestures. Objective performance indicators were derived from robotic system kinematic data. Force metrics were calculated from hydrogel model integrated sensors. Data were fitted to 3 supervised machine learning models - logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors - which were used to predict procedure-specific learning curve proficiency. Recursive feature elimination was used to optimize the best performing model.Results:Logistic regression predicted caseload with the highest AUC score for 5/7 possible data combinations (force, 64%; objective performance indicators + gestures, 94%; objective performance indicators + force, 90%; gestures + force, 93%; objective performance indicators + gestures + force, 94%). Support vector machine predicted the highest AUC score for objective performance indicators (82%) and gestures (94%). Logistic regression with recursive feature elimination was the most effective model reaching 96% AUC in predicting case-specific experience. Most contributory features were identified across all model types.Conclusions:We have created a machine learning-based algorithm utilizing a novel combination of objective performance indicators, gesture analysis, and integrated force metrics to predict surgical experience, capable of discriminating between surgeons with low or high robot-assisted radical prostatectomy caseload with 96% AUC in a standardized, simulation-based environment. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In some lymphoid malignancies (particularly ALL), Studies have shown that MRD monitoring of the peripheral blood may be an adequate alternative to frequent BM aspirations. However, additional studies investigating the biology of liquid biopsies in ALL and its potential as an MRD marker in larger patient cohorts in treatment protocols are warranted. Despite the promising data, there are still limitations in liquid biopsies in lymphoid malignancies, such as standardization of the sample collection and processing, determination of timing and duration for liquid biopsy analysis, and definition of the biological characteristics and specificity of the techniques evaluated such as flow cytometry, molecular techniques, and next generation sequencies. The use of liquid biopsy for detection of minimal residual disease in T-cell lymphoma is still experimental but it has made significant progress in multiple myeloma for example. Recent attempt to use artificial intelligence may help simplify the algorithm for testing and may help avoid inter-observer variation and operator dependency in these highly technically demanding testing process.

The patient's images are obtained by using a pair of opposing large flat gamma ray detectors equipped with parallel-hole lead or tungsten collimators that preferentially detect gamma-rays that are emitted perpendicular to the plane of the detector. The resulting images form an anterior/posterior (A/P) planar image pairs. The obtained images are contaminated by noise and contain artifacts caused by gamma-ray attenuation, collimator penetration, scatter and other detrimental factors. Post-filtering of the images can reduce the noise, but at the cost of spatial resolution loss, and cannot remove any of the aforementioned artifacts. In this study, we introduced a new image reconstruction-based method to recover a single corrected planar scintigraphic patient image corrected for attenuation, system spatial resolution and collimator penetration, using the A/P image pair (two conjugated views) as data. To accomplish this task, we used a system model based on the gamma camera detectors physical properties and applied regularization method based on sparse image representation to control noise while preserving spatial resolution. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the proposed approach using simple numerical phantoms. The images were evaluated for simulated lesions images contrast and background variability. Our initial results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods. We conclude, that the proposed approach is a promising methodology for improved planar scintigraphic image quality and warrants further exploration.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In this study, the probable sources of fecal contamination were determined. Also, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) were detected in the two main rivers of central Chile. Surface water samples were collected from 12 sampling sites in the Maipo (n = 8) and Maule Rivers (n = 4) every 3 months, from August 2017 until April 2019. To determine the fecal contamination level, fecal coliforms were quantified using the most probable number (MPN) method and the source of fecal contamination was determined by Microbial Source Tracking (MST) using the Cryptosporidium and Giardia genotyping method. Separately, to determine if antimicrobial resistance bacteria (AMB) were present in the rivers, Escherichia coli and environmental bacteria were isolated, and the antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined. Fecal coliform levels in the Maule and Maipo Rivers ranged between 1 and 130 MPN/100-ml, and 2 and 30,000 MPN/100-ml, respectively. Based on the MST results using Cryptosporidium and Giardia host-specific species, human, cattle, birds, and/or dogs hosts were the probable sources of fecal contamination in both rivers, with human and cattle host-specific species being more frequently detected. Conditional tree analysis indicated that coliform levels were significantly associated with the river system (Maipo versus Maule), land use, and season. Fecal coliform levels were significantly (p < 0.006) higher at urban and agricultural sites than at sites immediately downstream of treatment centers, livestock areas, or natural areas. Three out of eight (37.5%) E. coli isolates presented a multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype. Similarly, 6.6% (117/1768) and 5.1% (44/863) of environmental isolates, in Maipo and Maule River showed and MDR phenotype. Efforts to reduce fecal discharge into these rivers should thus focus on agriculture and urban land uses as these areas were contributing the most and more frequently to fecal contamination into the rivers, while human and cattle fecal discharges were identified as the most likely source of this fecal contamination by the MST approach. This information can be used to design better mitigation strategies, thereby reducing the burden of waterborne diseases and AMR in Central Chile.

With the rapid growth of using smart devices and social network applications in our daily life, more and more people start establishing connections with people through the social network. Therefore, designing a framework for organizing social events and activities based on collected historical data of smart devices is an efficient way to encourage people to enjoy activities they like with people they can get along well. In this paper, we proposed a smart social event invitation framework to select invitation receivers for an event organizer based on smart device historical data of owners. Habits and abilities of smart device owners can be summarized from the historical data. The selection algorithms would choose invitation receivers who have time and ability to attend the event. Moreover, in order to guarantee each participant can enjoy participating in the event, we proposed two algorithms, greedy searching and k-core algorithm, to pick invitation receivers. k-core algorithm uses k-core graph theory to ensure that each receiver has at least k friends are invited as well. Also, the proposed framework encourages less active or isolated people via issuing higher priority to them thus improving overall active levels of all members. The simulation results show that our proposed framework has good performance. © 2016 IEEE.","","Cai Z.; Luo G.; Cheng L.; Angryk R.; Li Y.; Bourgeois A.; Song W.; Cao X.; Krishnamachari B.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-150903936-4","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It is estimated that at least 5 million Americans have lupus, with more than 16,000 new cases of lupus being reported annually in the United States. Social media provides a platform for patients to find rheumatologists and peers and build awareness of the condition. Researchers have suggested that the social network Twitter may serve as a rich avenue for exploring how patients communicate about their health issues. However, there is a lack of research about the characteristics of lupus patients on Twitter and their attitudes toward using Twitter for engaging them with their health care. Objective: This study has two objectives: (1) to conduct a content analysis of Twitter data published by users (in English) in the United States between September 1, 2017 and October 31, 2018 to identify patients who publicly discuss their lupus condition and to assess their expressed health themes and (2) to conduct a cross-sectional survey among these lupus patients on Twitter to study their attitudes toward using Twitter for engaging them with their health care. Methods: This is a mixed methods study that analyzes retrospective Twitter data and conducts a cross-sectional survey among lupus patients on Twitter. We used Symplur Signals, a health care social media analytics platform, to access the Twitter data and analyze user-generated posts that include keywords related to lupus. We will use descriptive statistics to analyze the data and identify the most prevalent topics in the Twitter content among lupus patients. We will further conduct self-report surveys via Twitter by inviting all identified lupus patients who discuss their lupus condition on Twitter. The goal of the survey is to collect data about the characteristics of lupus patients (eg, gender, race/ethnicity, educational level) and their attitudes toward using Twitter for engaging them with their health care. Results: This study has been funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Science through a Clinical and Translational Science Award. The institutional review board at the University of Southern California (HS-19-00048) approved the study. Data extraction and cleaning are complete. We obtained 47,715 Twitter posts containing terms related to ""lupus"" from users in the United States published in English between September 1, 2017 and October 31, 2018. We included 40,885 posts in the analysis. Data analysis was completed in Fall 2020. Conclusions: The data obtained in this pilot study will shed light on whether Twitter provides a promising data source for garnering health-related attitudes among lupus patients. The data will also help to determine whether Twitter might serve as a potential outreach platform for raising awareness of lupus among patients and implementing related health education interventions. © 2021 JMIR Research Protocols.

Therefore, predicting patients’ no-shows is necessary to use their appointment slots effectively. In the literature, filter feature selection methods have been prominently used for patient no-show prediction. However, filter methods are less effective than wrapper methods. This paper presents new wrapper methods based on three variants of the proposed algorithm, Opposition-based Self-Adaptive Cohort Intelligence (OSACI). The three variants of OSACI are referred to in this paper as OSACI-Init, OSACI-Update, and OSACI-Init_Update, which are formed by the integration of Self-Adaptive Cohort Intelligence (SACI) with three Opposition-based Learning (OBL) strategies; namely: OBL initialization, OBL update, and OBL initialization and update, respectively. The performance of the proposed algorithms was examined and compared with that of Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and SACI in terms of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, dimensionality reduction, and convergence speed. Patient no-show data of a primary care clinic in upstate New York was used in the numerical experiments. The results showed that the proposed algorithms outperformed the other compared algorithms by achieving higher dimensionality reduction and better convergence speed while achieving comparable AUC, sensitivity, and specificity scores. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","M.

Machine learning algorithms especially deep learning methods have emerged as a part of prediction tools for regional rainfall forecasting. This paper aims to design and implement a generic computing framework that can assemble a variety of machine learning algorithms as computational engines for regional rainfall forecasting in Upstate New York. The algorithms that have been bagged in the computing framework include the classical algorithms and the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Deep Neural Network, Wide Neural Network, Deep and Wide Neural Network, Reservoir Computing, and Long Short Term Memory methods. Through the experimental results and the performance comparisons of these various engines, we have observed that the SVM-and KNN-based method are outstanding models over other models in classification while DWNN-and KNN-based methods outstrip other models in regression, particularly those prevailing deep-learning-based methods, for handling uncertain and complex climatic data for precipitation forecasting. Meanwhile, the normalization methods such as Z-score and Minmax are also integrated into the generic computing framework for the investigation and evaluation of their impacts on machine learning models. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to estimate the association of obesity with the severity and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Data Sources: A systematic search was conducted from the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic through to 13 October 2021, on databases including Medline (PubMed), Embase, Science Web, and Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Registry. Preprint servers such as BioRxiv, MedRxiv, ChemRxiv, and SSRN were also scanned. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Full-length articles focusing on the association of obesity and outcome in COVID-19 patients were included. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used for study selection and data extraction. Our Population of interest were COVID-19 positive patients, obesity is our Intervention/Exposure point, Comparators are Non-obese vs obese patients The chief outcome of the study was the severity of the confirmed COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients in terms of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation/intubation with obesity. All-cause mortality in COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients with obesity was the secondary outcome of the study. Results: In total, 3,140,413 patients from 167 studies were included in the study. Obesity was associated with an increased risk of severe disease (RR=1.52, 95% CI 1.41-1.63, p<0.001, I2 = 97%). Similarly, high mortality was observed in obese patients (RR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16, p=0.006, I2 = 97%). In multivariate meta-regression on severity, the covariate of the female gender, pulmonary disease, diabetes, older age, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension was found to be significant and explained R2 = 40% of the between-study heterogeneity for severity. The aforementioned covariates were found to be significant for mortality as well, and these covariates collectively explained R2 = 50% of the between-study variability for mortality. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that obesity is significantly associated with increased severity and higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the inclusion of obesity or its surrogate body mass index in prognostic scores and improvement of guidelines for patient care management is recommended.

This paper provides a such paradigm for visual analysis on public health issues. By exploiting the advanced visualization tool based on cloud and artificial intelligence, we collect and analyze several data sets on PM2.5 air pollution, environments and public health in Beijing in order to discover the intrisic relations between those factors. The visual analytics illustrates that the incidences of respiratory diseases increase as the concentration of PM2.5 in the air increases and that a strong correlation exists to temperature. PM 2.5 concentrations are higher in cold winter months than in hot summer months. Meanwhile, an unexpected discovery from the investigation was the pattern found for air concentrations of PM2.5 throughout a 24-hour period. The levels of PM2.5 reach peak at midnight and drop to their lowest level at 2pm in the daytime.

This study compares a more accurately defined PST group (of impending fractures defined by CTRA) to AF for metastatic femoral disease. Methods: PST patients were enrolled and treated by the PI in a longitudinal multicenter study of impending pathologic fractures evaluated for accuracy by CTRA. The AF patients were also treated by the senior author and were identified by retrospective chart review. Fifty-five patients were treated surgically for metastatic femoral lesions and were divided into three groups for the purpose of this study: Group I (AF), Group II (PST-high), and Group III (PST-low). Demographic information, comorbidities, and clinical variables of interest were collected by retrospective chart review; cost data was collected by collaboration with our hospital financial personnel (office of the Chief Financial Officer). Results: Survival showed statistically significant differences favoring Group II. Transfusions in Group I were nearly twice those of Groups II and III, but there was no statistically significant (NS) difference between groups. Estimated blood loss (EBL) was generally with NS difference. Similarly, there were NS differences in LOS between groups. Discharge disposition showed statistically significant differences between groups (P=0.012, global). Discharge to home was highest in Group II (76%) and lowest in Group I (27%). Discharge to rehab was lowest in Group II (24%) and highest in Group I (47%). There were no discharges to hospice or morgue in Group II, while both occurred in Group I. Mean direct and total costs were highest in Group I ($18,837 and $31,997, respectively) and lowest in Group II ($16,094 and $27,357) but the differences were NS. Conclusions: This study shows benefits of PST over AF in a group of PST patients more accurately defined to have impending pathologic fractures by CTRA definition. © Annals of Joint.

To address these objectives, a mixed research methodology, including a thorough review of the literature (NL = 190) and an online survey (NS = 274), was utilized. In general, there is an increasing research interest in occupant health and a heightened interest in health-related projects, among professionals, following the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, among the nine different building attributes examined, indoor air quality was the most researched building attribute with a focus on occupant health and was also presumed to be the most important by the professionals. Professionals considered fatigue and musculoskeletal pain to be the most important physical well-being issues, and stress, anxiety, and depression to be the most important mental well-being issues that need to be the focus of design, construction, and operation of buildings to support and promote occupant health, while eye-related symptoms and loss of concentration were the most researched physical and mental well-being symptoms in the literature, respectively.

To explain, neither policy-makers nor producers know the exact effect of current and alternative farming practices on the contributions of specific cropped fields to nutrient pollution. Spatial heterogeneity of the production technology and environmental damage of runoff also precludes the formulation of an analytic solution, so that producer response to prospective policies is unknown a priori to the policy maker. To address the complexity arising from point source uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity, we draw on recent computational advances to reformulate the classic nonpoint source pollution problem as a multi-objective bilevel optimization problem, employing genetic algorithm (GA) solution methods. This computational framework explicitly accounts for the nested nature of farm-level management decisions in response to prospective agri-environmental policy incentives, and spatial heterogeneity of both production and pollution effects. Our application considers the optimal spatial targeting of multiple management practices in the Iowa Raccoon River Watershed, an intensive corn and soybean production region of the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Consistent with theory and previous empirical results, we find that combining multiple management practices, versus relying on single or one-size policies, lowers the total cost for a given level of nitrogen reduction. But we also find overall limited potential nitrogen reduction via implementing these practices on working land, suggesting the continued need for land retirement in meeting current nonpoint policy goals for the UMRB. We believe that the main contribution of this study lies in the novelty of the bilevel approach, which explicitly accounts for feedbacks between policy makers and agricultural producers, while the associated GA computational methods allow for better handling of large scale and complex spatial heterogeneity over the agricultural watershed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","M.B.

Compared to the previous gold standard diagnostic imaging fluorescein angiography, OCT is a noninvasive imaging modality that generates images of ocular tissues at a rapid speed. Two commonly used iterations of OCT include spectral-domain (SD) and swept-source (SS). Each comes with different wavelengths and tissue penetration capacities. OCT angiography (OCTA) is a functional extension of the OCT. It generates a large number of pixels to capture the tissue and underlying blood flow. This allows OCTA to measure ischemia and demarcation of the vasculature in a wide range of conditions. This review focused on the study of four commonly encountered diseases involving the retina including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), and macular telangiectasia (MacTel).

Thus, it is important to understand factors associated with fecal contamination of agricultural water sources. Since fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were used to monitor surface water for potential fecal contamination, the purpose of the present study was to characterize associations between environmental factors, and (i) FIB (E. coli, Enterococcus, and coliform) levels, and (ii) host-specific fecal marker detection. This study used data collected from 224 sites along 3 waterways, which spanned an urban-rural gradient around Syracuse, New York. Between 2008 and 2017, 2,816 water samples were collected, and E. coli, Enterococcus, and/or coliform concentrations were enumerated. Thirty-one samples were also tested for human and ruminant microbial source-tracking markers. Water quality (e.g., turbidity, nitrate) and weather data were also collected for each site. Univariable Bayesian regression was used to characterize the relationship between each microbial target and land use, water quality, and weather factor. For each model, probability of direction and region of practical equivalence overlap (ROPE) were calculated to characterize the association's direction and strength, respectively. While levels of different FIB were not correlated with each other, FIB levels were associated with environmental conditions. Specifically, FIB levels were also positively associated with temperature, nutrient and sediment levels. Log10 E. coli levels increased by 0.20 (CI = 0.11, 0.31) and log10 Enterococcus levels increased by 0.68 (CI = 0.08, 1.24) for each log10 increase in salinity and nitrate, respectively. These findings may indicate that similar processes drove microbial, sediment, and nutrient contamination of the sampled watersheds. While fecal contamination was strongly associated with land use, the direction of association varied between FIBs and the buffer distance used to calculate land use metrics. E. coli levels and human marker detection were positively associated with percent pasture cover within 122, 366, and 1,098 m of the sampling site, while Enterococcus and coliform levels were only associated with pasture cover within 1,098 m (not 122 or 366 m). Ruminant markers were positively associated with pasture cover within 122 m, but not 366 or 1,098 m. These findings highlight the importance of considering (i) adjacent land use (and associated non-point sources of contamination) when developing strategies for managing fecal hazards associated in agricultural and recreational water, and (ii) spatial scale (e.g., 122 vs. 1,098 m) when developing these strategies.

Also, non-invasive neuroimaging methods can be used to quantify changes in brain structure and function in patients with bipolar disorder. Aims To provide a comprehensive assessment of genetic findings associated with bipolar disorder, based on the evaluation of different genomic approaches and neuroimaging studies. Method We conducted a PubMed search of all relevant literatures from the beginning to the present, by querying related search strings. Results ANK3, CACNA1C, SYNE1, ODZ4 and TRANK1 are five genes that have been replicated as key gene candidates in bipolar disorder pathophysiology, through the investigated studies. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the identified variants is small (approximately 4.7%). Bipolar disorder polygenic risk scores are associated with other psychiatric phenotypes. The ENIGMA-BD studies show a replicable pattern of lower cortical thickness, altered white matter integrity and smaller subcortical volumes in bipolar disorder. Conclusions The low amount of explained phenotypic variance highlights the need for further large-scale investigations, especially among non-European populations, to achieve a more complete understanding of the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder and the missing heritability. Combining neuroimaging data with genetic data in large-scale studies might help researchers acquire a better knowledge of the engaged brain regions in bipolar disorder.

This review focuses on compiling information regarding general L. decemlineata biology, ecology, and management focusing on discussing biochemical and morphological potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plant traits that might be responsible for providing resistance; the review ends discussing past efforts to identify genetic material and highlights promising new strategies that may improve the efficiency of evaluation and selection of resistant material. Measurement strategies, that begin with field screening of segregating populations or wild germplasm to narrow research focus can be useful. Identifying particularly resistant or susceptible germplasm, will help researchers focus on studying the mechanisms of resistance in much greater detail which will help the development of long-term sustainable management program.

Along with billions of dollars lost annually, phishing attacks have led to significant data breaches, loss of corporate secrets, and espionage. Despite the significant threat, potential phishing targets have little theoretical or practical guidance on which phishing tactics are most dangerous and require heightened caution. The current study extends persuasion and motivation theory to postulate why certain influence techniques are especially dangerous when used in phishing attacks. We evaluated our hypotheses using a large field experiment that involved sending phishing messages to more than 2,600 participants. Results indicated a disparity in levels of danger presented by different influence techniques used in phishing attacks. Specifically, participants were less vulnerable to phishing influence techniques that relied on fictitious prior shared experience and were more vulnerable to techniques offering a high level of self-determination. By extending persuasion and motivation theory to explain the relative efficacy of phishers' influence techniques, this work clarifies significant vulnerabilities and lays the foundation for individuals and organizations to combat phishing through awareness and training efforts. © 2014 INFORMS.","","","INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences","10477047","","","","English","Inf.

Although the primary cutaneous melanoma can be managed by surgery, the advanced metastatic melanoma cannot be managed by surgery alone and thus, requires better therapeutic approaches. In view of high mortality rates due to metastatic melanoma, better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of malignant melanoma is urgently needed. Such information is expected to prove very valuable in early detection of potential metastatic lesions and developing newer therapeutic approaches in order to better manage this malignancy. This article reviews the available information on the molecular changes associated with malignant melanoma and discusses the potential of such information in facilitating the development of newer anti-melanoma therapeutics.

However, comprehensive models that can effectively explain the variations in solar PV deployment are lacking. This study aims to address this gap by introducing two innovative models: (i) a computer vision model that can estimate spatial distribution of solar PV deployment across neighborhoods using satellite images and (ii) a machine learning (ML) model predicting such distribution based on 43 factors. Our computer vision model using Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (Faster RCNN) achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 81% for identifying solar panels and 95% for identifying roofs. Using this model, we analyzed 652,795 satellite images from Colorado, USA, and found that approximately 7% of households in Colorado have rooftop PV systems, while solar panels cover around 2.5% of roof areas in the state as of early 2021. Of our 16 predictive models, the XGBoost models performed the best, explaining approximately 70% of the variance in rooftop solar deployment. We also found that the share of Democratic party votes, hail and strong wind risks, median home value, the percentage of renters, and solar PV permitting timelines are the key predictors of rooftop solar deployment in Colorado. This study provides insights for business and policy decision making to support more efficient and equitable grid infrastructure investment and distributed energy resource management. © 2023, The Author(s).","S.Y.

Previous shallow learning and deep learning strategies adopt the single learning model approach for intrusion detection. The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.  © 2020 The author(s).","W.

We apply a multi-input, multi-output profit maximization model to detailed farm-level production data from the Oregon Willamette Valley to predict each producer's response to a targeted fertilizer tax policy. Their resulting production decisions are included in a biophysical model of basin-level soil and water quality. Building on a general regulation problem for nonpoint pollution, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm to integrate the economic and biophysical models into one bilevel multiobjective optimization problem, the joint maximization of farm profits and minimization of Nitrate runoff resulting from fertilizer usage. This approach allows us to more fully endogenize fertilizer reduction cost, rather than assume an average cost relationship. The solution set of tax rates generates the Pareto optimal frontier at the watershed level. We then measure the tradeoffs between maximum profit and Nitrogen loading for individual farms, subject to the solution fertilizer tax policy. We find considerable variation in tradeoff values across the basin, which could be used to target incentives for reducing Nitrogen loading to agricultural producers under non-uniform control strategies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","M.

The most common symptoms include problems with communicating and abstract thinking, as well as disorientation. It is important to detect Alzheimer's disease in early stages so that cognitive functioning would be improved by medication and training. In this paper, we propose two attention model networks for detecting Alzheimer's disease from MRI images to help early detection efforts at the preclinical stage. We also compare the performance of these two attention network models with a baseline model. Recently available OASIS-3 Longitudinal Neuroimaging, Clinical, and Cognitive Dataset is used to train, evaluate and compare our models. The novelty of this research resides in the fact that we aim to detect Alzheimer's disease when all the parameters, physical assessments, and clinical data state that the patient is healthy and showing no symptoms.

Participants are asked to complete a questionnaire that assesses sociodemographic and cross-diagnostic clinical information, provide blood samples, and grant access to their existing medical records. The generated data and biosamples are available to both academic and industry researchers. In this manuscript, we outline the workflow and infrastructure of the MMHB, describe the clinical characteristics and representativeness of the sample collected so far, and reveal future plans for expansion and application. As of 31 October 2021, the MMHB contains a continuously growing set of data from 578 patients and 104 healthy controls (46.37% women; median age, 38.31 years). The five most common mental health diagnoses in the MMHB are recurrent depressive disorder (38.78%; ICD-10: F33), alcohol-related disorders (19.88%; ICD-10: F10), schizophrenia (19.69%; ICD-10: F20), depressive episode (15.94%; ICD-10: F32), and personality disorders (13.78%; ICD-10: F60). Compared with the average patient treated at the recruiting hospitals, MMHB participants have significantly more mental health-related contacts, less severe symptoms, and a higher level of functioning. The distribution of diagnoses is also markedly different in MMHB participants compared with individuals who did not participate in the biobank. After establishing the necessary infrastructure and initiating recruitment, the major tasks for the next phase of the MMHB project are to improve the pace of participant enrollment, diversify the sociodemographic and diagnostic characteristics of the sample, and improve the utilization of real-world data generated in routine clinical practice.

With the advent of body sensory technology like the Kinect, it is important to use motor activities for learning in good and effective ways. In this article, we aim to examine both empirical illustrations and theoretical underpinnings for the gesture-based or motor-based learning enabled by the body sensory technology. We review and distill salient concepts and ideas from the existing theoretical and empirical literature related to body-movement- and gesture-based learning, and propose a motorpsycho learning approach. In our discussion, the word/affix motor is synonym to gestures and body movements, and psycho is synonym to cognitive activities. We explore the important role that motors play in psychological activities, especially in cognitive learning. We argue that motors can facilitate psychological activities in learning by enhancing information processing, encoding, representing, and communicating. We also call for more empirical studies on technology-enhanced and gesture-based learning to design, practice, and examine the motorpsycho learning approach. © 2014, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","","","Springer Boston","10421629","","","","English","Educ.

It is often hard to judge which components of a study led to better results and whether better reported results represent a true improvement or an uncorrected bias inflating performance. We extracted information about the methods used and other differentiating features in genomic machine learning models. We used these features in linear regressions predicting model performance. We tested for univariate and multivariate associations as well as interactions between features. Of the models reviewed, 46&#x0025; used feature selection methods that can lead to data leakage. Across our models, the number of hyperparameter optimizations reported, data leakage due to feature selection, model type, and modeling an autoimmune disorder were significantly associated with an increase in reported model performance. We found a significant, negative interaction between data leakage and training size. Our results suggest that methods susceptible to data leakage are prevalent among genomic machine learning research, resulting in inflated reported performance. Best practice guidelines that promote the avoidance and recognition of data leakage may help the field avoid biased results.

The principal objective of this study is to review and synthesize studies of high-frequency NO−3 data that have aimed to improve understanding of the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes underlying episodic, diel, and long-term stream NO−3 dynamics. Investigations have provided unprecedented detail on hysteresis and flushing patterns during high flow, seasonal variation during baseflow, and responses to multiyear climate variation. Analyses of high-frequency data have led to notable advances in understanding how climate variation affects spatial and temporal NO−3 patterns, especially dry–wet cycles and antecedent moisture. Further advances have been limited by few investigations that include high-frequency measurements outside the channel and the short duration of many records. High-frequency data for multiple constituents have provided new insight to the relative roles of hydrology and biogeochemistry as highlighted by studies of the roles of autotrophic uptake, denitrification, riparian evapotranspira-tion, and temperature-driven changes in viscosity as drivers of diel patterns. Com-parisons of short duration high-frequency data with long duration low-frequency data have described similarities and differences in concentration–discharge patterns and highlighted the role of legacy stores. Investigators have applied innovative analysis approaches not previously possible with low-frequency or temporally irregular data. Future availability of long duration high-frequency data will provide new insight to processes, resulting in improved conceptual models and a deeper understanding of the role of climate variation.

However, traditional European cider-specific apples are largely unsuitable for production in modern systems and have not been widely adopted. Evaluation of the biochemical variability in apples can provide a better characterization of varieties for use in hard cider production. Many varieties exhibited extensive variability in biochemical traits. Varieties with high phenolics and acidity displayed greater plasticity of these traits between seasons, which supports the concept of “vintage quality” and opens new marketing opportunities. This study provides valuable insight for apple producers to integrate cider-specific and nonspecific varieties into their production systems. Summary: The North American fermented beverage market has undergone extensive growth in the fermented apple juice (hard cider) sector over the last decade. Traditional hard cider producing regions such as England, France, and Spain have historically utilized cider-specific apples that have desirable balances between sugar, organic acid, and phenolics. However, in North America, culinary apples (lower acidity and phenolics) are predominantly used, and information distinguishing the varieties with novel use for hard cider production is lacking. In this study, we evaluated variation of four major apple biochemical traits (total soluble solids, pH, titratable acidity, and total phenolics) as they relate to use for hard cider production by using a meta-analysis approach. We analyzed the variation in cider quality traits across 47 published works and more than 800 unique apple varieties, including an additional analysis of 142 varieties from cider apple germplasms in the United States. The biochemical traits of many varieties exhibited plasticity, and the characterization of a subset of varieties using two cider classification system revealed that most belonged to the “sweet” or “sharp” (acidic) categories rather than “bitter” (high phenolic content). We also compared the classification of a subset of varieties from two US germplasm resources across two seasons and found varieties that have high percent phenolics and/or malic acid experienced greater biochemical plasticity and potential classification change across vintages. Ultimately, this work provides information regarding the variability in apple biochemical traits and also suggests a unique opportunity for producers to market “vintage” quality. © 2022 The Authors.

Background: There is currently no proven benefit of LND in the setting of RCC, and its role remains controversial because of conflicting evidence. Patients who may benefit from LND are those at greatest risk of nodal disease, but the tools used to predict nodal involvement are limited due to unpredictable retroperitoneal lymphatics. The indications, templates, and extent of LND are also not standardized, adding to the ambiguity of current guidelines surrounding its use. Evidence Acquisition: A PubMed search of the literature from January 2017 to December 2022 was conducted using the search terms “renal cell carcinoma” or “renal cancer” in combination with “lymph node dissection” or “lymphadenectomy”. Case studies and editorials were excluded, whereas studies investigating the therapeutic effect of LND were classified as either demonstrating a benefit or no benefit. References of the studies and review articles were also searched for notable studies and findings that were outside the five-year literature search. The studies in this review were restricted to the English language. Results: Only a number of studies in recent years have found an association between the extent of LND and increased survival. Most studies do not indicate an associated benefit, and some even suggest a negative effect on survival. Most of these studies are retrospective. Conclusion: The therapeutic value of LND in RCC is still unclear, and although prospective data are needed, its declining rates and emerging new therapies make this unlikely. A better understanding of renal lymphatics and improved detection of nodal disease may help determine the role of LND in nonmetastatic localized RCC. © 2023 by the authors.","H.

The present study explored the technological usability and clinical feasibility of Smartglass-guided exposure in a behavioral approach test in spider-fearful individuals (N = 40). Fearful individuals were asked to start the Smartglass themselves and established a connection to a therapist, who guided the exposure test from afar. Clinical severity of spider fear was assessed via questionnaire. Technological usability was assessed with established measures of usability, user experience, and user acceptance. Exploratory, individual characteristics of exposure were collected (e.g., within-session fear reduction, duration, safety behavior). Overall, fearful individuals (94.9%) and therapists (100%) were able to establish a connection. Usability of Smartglass-guided exposure was evaluated as positive. Within-session fear reduction was large (d = 1.91). Adverse events were minimal. There were, however, some associations between exposure characteristics and usability evaluation (e.g., lower user-friendliness and exposure duration). Two case examples further highlight chances and risks of Smartglass-guided exposure. These findings provide first evidence that Smartglass-guided exposure could be useful in exposure therapy. Smartglass-guided exposure may ultimately help to increase practicability of exposure and increase dissemination, also in rural areas. These findings are promising for future research on the long-term outcome of evidence-based exposure in treatment seeking patients. © 2021 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies","A.

HCD is an iterative approach to problem-solving, focused on bringing together user needs, technological feasibility, and economic viability. Despite gaining popularity in other contexts, there are only few empirical studies on the application of the HCD approach in the public sector. We examine the case of the E!App, a smartphone application for emergency preparedness and response in Upstate New York, to understand the extent to which HCD improves technology adoption and identify some of the challenges associated with using HCD in the development of digital tools. Four focus group discussions and 12 interviews reveal that using the HCD approach facilitates the adoption of digital tools among users when their inputs are fully incorporated into the design. However, it is not always possible to include user inputs in the development of digital tools. More specifically, practical concerns related to inconsistent user feedback, technical feasibility, and long-term consequences of design choices create challenges in the design and development of digital tools. © 2023 ACM.","","Cid D.D.","Association for Computing Machinery","","979-840070837-4","","","English","ACM Int.

Controversy exists over the adequate extent of PLND for patients at different stages of PCa and over the therapeutic value of the procedure. The most recent consensus advocates extended PLND (ePLND) in a patient with Gleason score ≥7 and serum prostate-specific antigen >10 ng/ml who is undergoing radical prostatectomy. Critics claim more aggressive dissection is associated with an increase in complications, hospitalization time, and cost. The present review examines the debate of limited versus ePLND, and discusses the potential value of the latter for patients with PCa. Furthermore, it examines the utility of robotic-assisted surgery in performing PLNDs with both comparable oncological outcomes and comparable complication rates. The literature has reported promising results that support both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits of ePLND. However, prospective, multi-center, long-term studies are necessary to alleviate criticism of the increased risk of complications and costs of performing PLND. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","I.

Despite widespread success of many elimination initiatives, elimination efforts in some regions of the world have stalled. Barriers to malaria elimination include climate and land use changes, such as warming temperatures and urbanization, which can alter mosquito habitats. Socioeconomic factors, such as political instability and regional migration, also threaten elimination goals. This is particularly relevant in areas where local elimination has been achieved and consequently surveillance and control efforts are dwindling and are no longer a priority. Understanding how environmental change, impacts malaria elimination has important practical implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies. It is important to consider climate change when monitoring the threat of malaria resurgence due to socioeconomic influences. However, there is limited assessment of how the combination of climate variation, interventions and socioeconomic pressures influence long-term trends in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical mixed models and malaria case data for a 29-year period to disentangle the impacts of climate variation and malaria control efforts on malaria risk in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, which achieved local elimination in 2011. We found shifting patterns of malaria between rural and urban areas, with a relative increase of Plasmodium vivax in urbanized areas. Minimum temperature was an important driver of malaria seasonality and the association between warmer minimum temperatures and malaria incidence was greater for Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax malaria. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of three chemical vector control measures on both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. We found statistically significant associations between two of the three measures [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and space spraying] and a reduction in malaria incidence, which varied between malaria type. We also found environmental suitability for malaria transmission is increasing in El Oro, which could limit future elimination efforts if malaria is allowed to re-establish. Our findings have important implications for understanding environmental obstacles to malaria elimination and highlights the importance of designing and sustaining elimination efforts in areas that remain vulnerable to resurgence. © Copyright © 2020 Fletcher, Stewart-Ibarra, Sippy, Carrasco-Escobar, Silva, Beltran-Ayala, Ordoñez, Adrian, Sáenz, Drakeley, Jones and Lowe.","I.K.

Lung ultrasound is an imaging modality that is cost-effective, widely accessible, and can be used to diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. It can be used to find important characteristics in the images, including A-lines, B-lines, consolidation, and pleural effusion, which all inform the clinician in monitoring and diagnosing the disease. With the use of portable ultrasound transducers, lung ultrasound images can be easily acquired, however, the images are often of poor quality. They often require an expert clinician interpretation, which may be time-consuming and is highly subjective. We propose a method for fast and reliable interpretation of lung ultrasound images by use of deep learning, based on the Kinetics-I3D network. Our learned model can classify an entire lung ultrasound scan obtained at point-of-care, without requiring the use of preprocessing or a frame-by-frame analysis. We compare our video classifier against ground truth classification annotations provided by a set of expert radiologists and clinicians, which include A-lines, B-lines, consolidation, and pleural effusion. Our classification method achieves an accuracy of 90% and an average precision score of 95% with the use of 5-fold cross-validation. The results indicate the potential use of automated analysis of portable lung ultrasound images to assist clinicians in screening and diagnosing patients. © 2021 The Authors","D.

However, such high-dimensional datasets make computation costly and can complicate the interpretation of a predictive model. To address this, feature selection methods are used to extract biological information from a large amount of data in order to filter the expression dataset down to the smallest possible subset of accurate predictor genes. Feature selection has three main advantages: it decreases computational costs, mitigates the possibility of overfitting due to high inter-variable correlations, and allows for an easier clinical interpretation of the model. In this paper we compare three methods of feature selection: iterative Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) and five methods of survival analysis: Analysis Random Survival Forest (RSF), Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH), Alan Additive Filter (AAF), DeepSurv (neural network), and CbrSurv (case-based reasoning), which we introduce in this paper. Features selected by these methods are compared with a hand selected set of features. All the data we used came from the Metabric breast cancer dataset. Our results indicate that feature selection improves the performance of survival analysis methods. Overall, the best survival analysis performance was obtained by combining RSF for feature selection and CbrSurv, closely followed by DeepSurv, for survival prediction.

Managing and mining this data is a new academic and industrial challenge. Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of nodes in a social network that result in the highest amount of influence diffusion. Many research works have been developed, which focus exclusively on the efficiency of algorithms, but overlook some features of social network data such as time sensitivity and the practicality in a large scale. Furthermore, the new era of 'big data' is changing dramatically right before our eyes-the increase of big data growth gives all researchers many challenges as well as opportunities. This paper proposes two new models TIC and TLT and considers the time constraint during the influence spreading process in practice. Empirical studies on different synthetic and real large scale social networks demonstrate that our models together with solutions on both Hadoop and Spark platforms are more practical as well as providing a regulatory mechanism for enhancing influence maximization.

Valid and reliable assessment of pain is essential for both clinical trials and effective pain management. A major limitation of automatic pain assessment by the facial expression is the lack of clinically validated data.

Kernel machine regression (KMR) is a highly flexible pathway analysis approach. Initially, KMR was developed to analyze a simple phenotype with just one measurement per individual. Recently, however, the investigation into the influence of genomic factors in the development of disease-related phenotypes across time (trajectories) has gained in importance. Thus, novel statistical approaches for KMR analyzing longitudinal data, i.e. several measurements at specific time points per individual are required. For longitudinal pathway analysis, we extend KMR to long-KMR using the estimation equivalence of KMR and linear mixed models. We include additional random effects to correct for the dependence structure. Moreover, within long-KMR we created a topology-based pathway analysis by combining this approach with a kernel including network information of the pathway. Most importantly, long-KMR not only allows for the investigation of the main genetic effect adjusting for time dependencies within an individual, but it also allows to test for the association of the pathway with the longitudinal course of the phenotype in the form of testing the genetic time-interaction effect. The approach is implemented as an R package, kalpra. Our simulation study demonstrates that the power of long-KMR exceeded that of another KMR method previously developed to analyze longitudinal data, while maintaining (slightly conservatively) the type I error. The network kernel improved the performance of long-KMR compared to the linear kernel. Considering different pathway densities, the power of the network kernel decreased with increasing pathway density. We applied long-KMR to cognitive data on executive function (Trail Making Test, part B) from the PsyCourse Study and 17 candidate pathways selected from Reactome. We identified seven nominally significant pathways. Copyright © 2022 Wendel, Heidenreich, Budde, Heilbronner, Oraki Kohshour, Papiol, Falkai, Schulze, Heilbronner and Bickeböller.","B.

Resilience to human-made disasters, such as oil or gas spills, can be improved by using prescriptive models developed by analyzing past behavior. This type of study is useful for urban planning and monitoring, as there is a higher probability of human triggered disasters in densely populated areas. Design/methodology/approach – This study examined 10 years of more than 1,000 oil–gas disasters that were caused by humans in the upstate New York area to illustrate how a prescriptive model could be developed. Findings – A statistically significant predictive model was developed that indicated humans in certain industry categories were approximately six times more likely to have an oil–gas accident resulting in environmental pollution. Research limitations/implications – A prescriptive environmental protection model based on human accident behavior would generalize to all levels of government for policy planning, and it would be relevant to environmental protection groups in any region with a large population of humans using oil and gas (that covers most countries on earth). Originality/value – The empirical risk management literature was reviewed to identify factors related to environmental accident prediction with the goal of developing an explanatory model that would fit the oil–gas human accident data. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","K.D.D.

The untrusted LBS server has all the information about users in the LBS and it may track them in various ways or release their privacy data to third parties. To address the privacy protection issue, many location obfuscation algorithms behind a location-privacy preserving mechanisms (LPPMs) were proposed but only approached the trade-off between utility and privacy. Unlike the existing approaches, we propose the first methodology and application, to the best of our knowledge, that enables a near-complete location privacy protection for LBS users to achieve an cognitive optimal resolution by employing the social network associated with the LBS to separate the utility and privacy. Evaluation of both simulation and practical smartphone application shows that the proposed methodology could achieve a near-complete privacy protection in terms of entropy and significantly improve the quality of service utility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Robust matchup analyses are crucial in consistent monitoring of ocean and coastal/inland waters. Differences in the spectral bands of various multispectral satellite sensors and in situ radiometers are one of the sources of uncertainties in matchup analyses. These uncertainties are also present in direct sensor-to-sensor comparisons of R rs products. To account for the differences in the spectral bands, this manuscript evaluates the utility of deep neural networks (DNN) and compares its performance against other existing methods. A large database of simulated R spectra and a fairly comprehensive hyperspectral rs in situ R data set were utilized for training and testing. It was found that the DNN rs outperforms other existing methods leading to band-average root-mean squared errors of < 4e−4 and < 2.5e−4 1/sr for matchup analyses and sensor-to-sensor Rrs intercomparisons, respectively. These uncertainties are at least ~2X and 3X better than the other methods. The largest uncertainties (i.e., differences in 1/sr) were found when dealing with the green bands over highly turbid and eutrophic waters. The analyses of actual AERONET-OC matchups indicated the need for spectral band adjustments, in particular, in the red channel. It was further revealed that the DNN performance is particularly superior in highly eutrophic and turbid waters. Further research may include exploring other machine-learning techniques or improving the architecture of the neural networks. © 2017 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","N.

The cohort was derived via a post-hoc analysis of a prospective randomized clinical trial examining definitive SBRT for peripheral, early-stage NSCLC with a single or multi-fraction regimen. Patients completed HRQOL questionnaires prior to and 3 months after treatment. Using principal component analysis (PCA), changes in each HRQOL scale following treatment were reduced to two eigenvectors, PC1 and PC2. Cox regression was employed to analyze associations with survival-based endpoints. A total of 70 patients (median age 75.6 years; median follow-up 41.1 months) were studied. HRQOL and symptom comparisons at baseline and 3 months were vastly unchanged except for improved coughing (p = 0.02) and pain in the chest at 3 months (p = 0.033). PC1 and PC2 explained 21% and 9% of variance, respectively. When adjusting for covariates, PC1 was significantly correlated with progression-free (PFS) (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.46, p = 0.041). Changes in global health status, functional HRQOL performance, and/or symptom burden as described by PC1 values are significantly associated with PFS and OS.

However, it is difficult to train such deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel structure called cross-layer neurons architecture, which has the capability to train effective deeper neural networks. It utilizes cross-layer neurons to synthesize the information (features) learned from all the lower-level layers and send them to the higher-level layers through the cross-layer. Based on this novel architecture, we propose a new deep neural model termed Cross-Layer Neurons Networks (CLNN). It is shown that CLNN can relieve the problem of vanishing gradient. It is also shown that CLNN has the capability of improving the convergence rate of classification. Comparative experiments on several benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10) clearly demonstrate that our proposed model is suitable for training deeper networks and can effectively improve the performance by utilizing cross-layer neurons. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","T.

This review synthesizes the extant knowledge and research findings related to the economic impacts of Walmart's entry into, and subsequent domination of, food retailing in the United States and more broadly globally. The findings suggest five broad generalizations: (a) Walmart's physical growth in the United States has slowed considerably, but the company is growing rapidly in terms of total assets, digital capabilities, international presence, and sales per square foot; (b) Walmart's entry and presence are associated with lower food prices for households; (c) Walmart has considerable negative impacts on large competitors, particularly supermarkets, but the evidence for Walmart's deleterious impacts on small businesses is limited; (d) there is no consensus on the impact of Walmart on local employment, but most studies on the topic point to a modest increase in retail employment; and (e) Walmart likely increases food access but does not improve dietary quality. © 2022 Annual Reviews Inc..

To tackle this problem, the distributed privacy-preserving learning approaches are introduced to learn over all distributed data without exposing the real information. However, existing approaches have limits on the complicated distributed system. On the one hand, traditional privacy-preserving learning approaches rely on heavy cryptographic primitives on training data, in which the learning speed is dramatically slowed down due to the computation overheads. On the other hand, the complicated system architecture becomes a barrier in the practical distributed system. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving machine learning scheme for hierarchical distributed systems. We modify and improve the collaborative learning algorithm. The proposed scheme not only reduces the overhead for the learning process but also provides the comprehensive protection for each layer of the hierarchical distributed system. In addition, based on the analysis of the collaborative convergency in different learning groups, we also propose an asynchronous strategy to further improve the learning efficiency of hierarchical distributed system. At the last, extensive experiments on real-world data are implemented to evaluate the privacy, efficacy, and efficiency of our proposed schemes. © 2013 IEEE.","L.

As the diffusion tensor model has limitations in brain regions with crossing fibers, novel diffusion MRI reconstruction models may offer more accurate measures of tissue properties, and a better understanding of the brain abnormalities in specific diseases. Here we studied a large sample of 249 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with high rates of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, and 224 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (age range: 8-35 years). Participants were scanned with dMRI at eight centers worldwide. Using a meta-analytic approach, we assessed the profile of group differences in four diffusion anisotropy measures to better understand the patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities and evaluate their consistency across alternative measures. When assessed in atlas-defined regions of interest, we found statistically significant differences for all anisotropy measures, all showing a widespread but not always coinciding pattern of effects. The tensor distribution function fractional anisotropy (TDF-FA) showed largest effect sizes all in the same direction (greater anisotropy in 22q11DS than HC). Fractional anisotropy based on the tensor model (FA) showed the second largest effect sizes after TDF-FA; some regions showed higher mean values in 22q11DS, but others lower. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) showed the opposite pattern to TDF-FA with most regions showing lower anisotropy in 22q11DS versus HC. Anisotropic power maps (AP) showed the lowest effect sizes also with a mixed pattern of effects across regions. These results were also consistent across skeleton projection methods, with few differences when projecting anisotropy values from voxels sampled on the FA map or projecting values from voxels sampled from each anisotropy map. This study highlights that different mathematical definitions of anisotropy may lead to different profiles of group differences, even in large, well-powered population studies. Further studies of biophysical models derived from multi-shell dMRI and histological validations may help to understand the sources of these differences. 22q11DS is a promising model to study differences among novel anisotropy/dMRI measures, as group differences are relatively large and there exist animal models suitable for histological validation. © SPIE.

Human–environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio-environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data. © 2021 The Authors.","E.M.

This negative trajectory is associated with high comorbidity with disorders like obesity, depression, or substance use disorder (SUD). Decreases in cortical volume and thickness have also been reported in depression, SUD, and obesity, but it is unclear whether structural brain alterations represent unique disorder-specific profiles. A transdiagnostic exploration of ADHD and typical comorbid disorders could help to understand whether specific morphometric brain changes are due to ADHD or, alternatively, to the comorbid disorders. In the current study, we studied the brain morphometry of 136 subjects with ADHD with and without comorbid depression, SUD, and obesity to test whether there are unique or common brain alterations. We employed a machine-learning-algorithm trained to classify subjects with ADHD in the large ENIGMA-ADHD dataset and used it to predict the diagnostic status of subjects with ADHD and/or comorbidities. The parcellation analysis demonstrated decreased cortical thickness in medial prefrontal areas that was associated with presence of any comorbidity. However, these results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Similarly, the machine learning analysis indicated that the predictive algorithm grouped most of our ADHD participants as belonging to the ADHD-group, but no systematic differences between comorbidity status came up. In sum, neither a classical comparison of segmented structural brain metrics nor an ML model based on the ADHD ENIGMA data differentiate between ADHD with and without comorbidities. As the ML model is based in part on adolescent brains, this might indicate that comorbid disorders and their brain changes are not captured by the ML model because it represents a different developmental brain trajectory.

Competitors were evaluated on several aspects of out-of-sample forecasts including the targets of peak week, peak incidence during that week, and total season incidence across each of several seasons. Our team was one of the winners of that competition, outperforming other teams in multiple targets/locales. In this paper we report on our methodology, a large component of which, surprisingly, ignores the known biology of epidemics at large—for example, relationships between dengue transmission and environmental factors—and instead relies on flexible nonparametric nonlinear Gaussian process (GP) regression fits that “memorize” the trajectories of past seasons, and then “match” the dynamics of the unfolding season to past ones in real-time. Our phenomenological approach has advantages in situations where disease dynamics are less well understood, or where measurements and forecasts of ancillary covariates like precipitation are unavailable, and/or where the strength of association with cases are as yet unknown. In particular, we show that the GP approach generally outperforms a more classical generalized linear (autoregressive) model (GLM) that we developed to utilize abundant covariate information. We illustrate variations of our method(s) on the two benchmark locales alongside a full summary of results submitted by other contest competitors. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2018.","","","Institute of Mathematical Statistics","19326157","","","","English","Ann.

With the rapid growth of social network applications, more and more people get used to creating connections with people on the social network. Therefore, designing social network framework for partner-matching is significant in helping people to easily find good partners. In this paper, we proposed a framework which can match partners for an active community. In order to improve the matching performance, all users are divided into groups based on a specific classification tree that is built for a specific activity. The optimization goal of the partner-matching is to maintain as many stable partnerships as possible in the community. To achieve the goal, various factors are considered to design matching functions. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can help most people find stable partners quickly. © 2014, Ai et al.; licensee Springer.","C.

However, non-expert programmers may struggle to implement the elaborate pipelines necessary to build highly accurate and generalizable models. We introduce exprso, a new R package that is an intuitive machine learning suite designed specifically for non-expert programmers. Built initially for the classification of high-dimensional data, exprso uses an object-oriented framework to encapsulate a number of common analytical methods into a series of interchangeable modules. This includes modules for feature selection, classification, high-throughput parameter grid-searching, elaborate cross-validation schemes (e.g., Monte Carlo and nested cross-validation), ensemble classification, and prediction. In addition, exprso also supports multi-class classification (through the 1-vs-all generalization of binary classifiers) and the prediction of continuous outcomes. © 2017 Quinn T et al.","T.

Whilst pharmacological treatments are generally effective and safe, there is considerable inter-individual variability among patients regarding treatment response, required dose, and tolerability. Many of the non-pharmacological treatments, which are preferred to drug-treatment by some patients, either lack efficacy for core symptoms or are associated with small effect sizes. No evidence-based decision tools are currently available to allocate pharmacological or psychosocial treatments based on the patient's clinical, environmental, cognitive, genetic, or biological characteristics. We systematically reviewed potential biomarkers that may help in diagnosing ADHD and/or stratifying ADHD into more homogeneous subgroups and/or predict clinical course, treatment response, and long-term outcome across the lifespan. Most work involved exploratory studies with cognitive, actigraphic and EEG diagnostic markers to predict ADHD, along with relatively few studies exploring markers to subtype ADHD and predict response to treatment. There is a critical need for multisite prospective carefully designed experimentally controlled or observational studies to identify biomarkers that index inter-individual variability and/or predict treatment response.

Our study applies unsupervised clustering techniques to analyze metabolomic data, acquired using 2 different tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) methods, from an unselected group of 120 patients with psychosis. We performed an independent analysis of each of the 2 datasets generated, by both hierarchical clustering and k-means. This led to the identification of biochemically distinct groups of patients while reducing the potential biases from any single clustering method or datatype. Using our newly developed robust clustering method, which is based on patients consistently grouped together through different methods and datasets, a total of 20 clusters were ascertained and 78 patients (or 65% of the original cohort) were placed into these robust clusters. Medication exposure was not associated with cluster formation in our study. We highlighted metabolites that constitute nodes (cluster-specific metabolites) vs hubs (metabolites in a central, shared, pathway) for psychosis. For example, 4 recurring metabolites (spermine, C0, C2, and PC.aa.C38.6) were discovered to be significant in at least 8 clusters, which were identified by at least 3 different clustering approaches. Given these metabolites were affected across multiple biochemically different patient subgroups, they are expected to be important in the overall pathophysiology of psychosis. We demonstrate how knowledge about such hubs can lead to novel antipsychotic medications. Such pathways, and thus drug targets, would not have been possible to identify without patient stratification, as they are not shared by all patients, due to the heterogeneity of psychosis.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Method: Verbal fluency lists (animals, vegetables, F, A, and S) from 107 MCI patients and 51 cognitively normal controls were transcribed into electronic text files and automatically scored with traditional raw scores and five types of novel scores computed using methods from machine learning and natural language processing. Additional scores were derived from structural MRI scans: region of interest measures of hippocampal and ventricular volumes and gray matter scores derived from performing ICA on measures of cortical thickness. Over 4 years of follow-up, 24 MCI patients converted to AD. Using conversion as the outcome variable, ensemble classifiers were constructed by training classifiers on the individual groups of scores and then entering predictions from the primary classifiers into regularized logistic regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was measured for classifiers trained with five groups of available variables. Results: Classifiers trained with novel scores outperformed those trained with raw scores (AUC 0.872 vs 0.735; P < .05 by DeLong test). Addition of structural brain measurements did not improve performance based on novel scores alone. Conclusion: The brevity and cost profile of verbal fluency tasks recommends their use for clinical decision making. The word lists generated are a rich source of information for predicting outcomes in MCI. Further work is needed to assess the utility of verbal fluency for early AD. © 2016 The Authors.","D.G.

About 90% of people indicate elevated levels of anxiety during pre-operative care, and 66% of the people report moderate to high levels of pain immediately after surgery. Currently, opioids are the primary method for pain management during postoperative care, and approximately one in 16 surgical patients prescribed opioids becomes a long-Term user. This, along with the current opioid epidemic crisis calls for alternative pain management mechanisms. This research focuses on utilizing affective computing techniques to develop and deliver an adaptive virtual reality experience based on the user's physiological response to reduce pain and anxiety. Biofeedback is integrated with a virtual environment utilizing the user's heart rate variability, respiration, and electrodermal activity. Early results from Total Knee Arthroplasty patients undergoing surgery at Patewood Memorial Hospital in Greenville, SC demonstrate promising results in the management of pain and anxiety during pre and post-operative care. © 2019 IEEE.","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172815604-0","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Blood components then undergo molecular analysis by flow cytometry or sequencing techniques and can be used as a powerful tool for prognostic and predictive purposes in myeloid malignancies. There is evidence and more is evolving about the quantification and identification of cell-based and gene-based biomarkers in myeloid malignancies to monitor treatment response. MRD based acute myeloid leukemia protocol and clinical trials are currently incorporating LB testing and preliminary results are encouraging for potential widespread use in clinic in the near future. MRD monitoring using LBs are not standard in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) but this is an area of active investigation. In the future, LBs can replace more invasive techniques such as bone marrow biopsies. However, the routine clinical application of these markers continues to be an issue due to lack of standardization and limited number of studies investigating their specificities. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) could help simplify the complex interpretation of molecular testing and reduce errors related to operator dependency. Though the field is rapidly evolving, the applicability of MRD testing using LB is mostly limited to research setting at this time due to the need for validation, regulatory approval, payer coverage, and cost issues. This review focuses on the types of biomarkers, most recent research exploring MRD and LB in myeloid malignancies, ongoing clinical trials, and the future of LB in the setting of AI.

These expensive tests also require specialized technicians to operate. We present a low-cost, patient-centered device for the initial screening of the heart sounds that can be potentially used by the users on themselves. They can later share these readings with their healthcare providers. We have created an innovative mobile-health service platform for analyzing and classifying heart sounds. The presented system enables remote patient-monitoring by integrating advanced wireless communications with a customized low-cost stethoscope. This system also permits remote management of a patient's cardiac status while maximizing patient mobility. The smartphone application facilitates recording, processing, visualizing, listening to, and classification of heart sounds. We build our classification model using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and Hidden Markov Model.

This growth has been spurred by diverse cross-institutional and interdisciplinary collaborations, public availability of large datasets, an increase in the accessibility of analytic routines, and the availability of powerful computing resources. With this increased access and exposure to machine learning comes a responsibility for education and a deeper understanding of its bases and bounds, borne equally by data scientists seeking to ply their analytic wares in medical research and by biomedical scientists seeking to harness such methods to glean knowledge from data. This article provides an accessible and critical review of machine learning for a biomedically informed audience, as well as its applications in psychiatry. The review covers definitions and expositions of commonly used machine learning methods, and historical trends of their use in psychiatry. We also provide a set of standards, namely Guidelines for REporting Machine Learning Investigations in Neuropsychiatry (GREMLIN), for designing and reporting studies that use machine learning as a primary data-analysis approach. Lastly, we propose the establishment of the Machine Learning in Psychiatry (MLPsych) Consortium, enumerate its objectives, and identify areas of opportunity for future applications of machine learning in biological psychiatry. This review serves as a cautiously optimistic primer on machine learning for those on the precipice as they prepare to dive into the field, either as methodological practitioners or well-informed consumers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","S.J.

This study aims to present a Statistical, inherent Optical property (IOP) -based, and muLti-conditional Inversion proceDure (SOLID) for enhanced retrievals of satellite-derived TSS under a wide range of in-water bio-optical conditions in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters. In this study, using a large in situ database (N > 3500), the SOLID model is devised using a three-step procedure: (a) water-type classification of the input remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), (b) retrieval of particulate backscattering (bbp) in the red or near-infrared (NIR) regions using semi-analytical, machine-learning, and empirical models, and (c) estimation of TSS from bbp via water-type-specific empirical models. Using an independent subset of our in situ data (N = 2729) with TSS ranging from 0.1 to 2626.8 [g/m3], the SOLID model is thoroughly examined and compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms (Miller and McKee, 2004; Nechad et al., 2010; Novoa et al., 2017; Ondrusek et al., 2012; Petus et al., 2010). We show that SOLID outperforms all the other models to varying degrees, i.e.,from 10 to >100%, depending on the statistical attributes (e.g., global versus water-type-specific metrics). For demonstration purposes, the model is implemented for images acquired by the MultiSpectral Imager aboard Sentinel-2A/B over the Chesapeake Bay, San-Francisco-Bay-Delta Estuary, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu. To enable generating consistent, multimission TSS products, its performance is further extended to, and evaluated for, other missions, such as the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Sensitivity analyses on uncertainties induced by the atmospheric correction indicate that 10% uncertainty in Rrs leads to <20% uncertainty in TSS retrievals from SOLID. While this study suggests that SOLID has a potential for producing TSS products in global coastal and inland waters, our statistical analysis certainly verifies that there is still a need for improving retrievals across a wide spectrum of particle loads. © 2020 The Authors","N.

Efforts to define biomarkers of ASD have not resulted in an objective, reliable test. Studies of RNA levels in ASD have demonstrated potential utility, but have been limited by a focus on single RNA types, small sample sizes, and lack of developmental delay controls. We hypothesized that a saliva-based poly-“omic” RNA panel could objectively distinguish children with ASD from their neurotypical peers and children with non-ASD developmental delay. Methods: This multi-center cross-sectional study included 456 children, ages 19–83 months. Children were either neurotypical (n = 134) or had a diagnosis of ASD (n = 238), or non-ASD developmental delay (n = 84). Comprehensive human and microbial RNA abundance was measured in the saliva of all participants using unbiased next generation sequencing. Prior to analysis, the sample was randomly divided into a training set (82% of subjects) and an independent validation test set (18% of subjects). The training set was used to develop an RNA-based algorithm that distinguished ASD and non-ASD children. The validation set was not used in model development (feature selection or training) but served only to validate empirical accuracy. Results: In the training set (n = 372; mean age 51 months; 75% male; 51% ASD), a set of 32 RNA features (controlled for demographic and medical characteristics), identified ASD status with a cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86–0.88). In the completely separate validation test set (n = 84; mean age 50 months; 85% male; 60% ASD), the algorithm maintained an AUC of 0.88 (82% sensitivity and 88% specificity). Notably, the RNA features were implicated in physiologic processes related to ASD (axon guidance, neurotrophic signaling). Conclusion: Salivary poly-omic RNA measurement represents a novel, non-invasive approach that can accurately identify children with ASD. This technology could improve the specificity of referrals for ASD evaluation or provide objective support for ASD diagnoses. © Copyright © 2018 Hicks, Rajan, Wagner, Barns, Carpenter and Middleton.","S.D.

The relatively small number of school shooters, their various characteristics, and the lack of in-depth analysis of all of the shooters prior to the shooting add complexity to our understanding of this problem. In this short paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatically profiling school shooters. The methodology involves automatic analysis of texts and the production of several measures relevant for the identification of the shooters. Comparing texts written by 6 school shooters to 6056 texts written by a comparison group of male subjects, we found that the shooters' texts scored significantly higher on the Narcissistic Personality dimension as well as on the Humilated and Revengeful dimensions. Using a ranking/prioritization procedure, similar to the one used for the automatic identification of sexual predators, we provide support for the validity and relevance of the proposed methodology. © 2015 Neuman, Assaf, Cohen and Knoll.","","","Frontiers Research Foundation","16640640","","","","English","Front.
