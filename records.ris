N2  - Background: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in the treatment of inflammatory liver diseases and sepsis, but GC's various side effects on extrahepatic tissues limit their clinical benefits. Liver-targeting GC therapy may have multiple advantages over systemic GC therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop novel liver-targeting GC prodrugs as improved treatment for inflammatory liver diseases and sepsis. Methods: A hydrophilic linker or an ultra-hydrophilic zwitterionic linker carboxylic betaine (CB) was used to bridge cholic acid (CA) and dexamethasone (DEX) to generate transporter-dependent liver-targeting GC prodrugs CA-DEX and the highly hydrophilic CA-CB-DEX. The efficacy of liver-targeting DEX prodrugs and DEX were determined in primary human hepatocytes (PHH), macrophages, human whole blood, and/or mice with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Results: CA-DEX was moderately water soluble, whereas CA-CB-DEX was highly water soluble. CA-CB-DEX and CA-DEX displayed highly transporter-dependent activities in reporter assays. Data mining found marked dysregulation of many GR-target genes important for lipid catabolism, cytoprotection, and inflammation in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. These key GR-target genes were similarly and rapidly (within 6 h) induced or down-regulated by CA-CB-DEX and DEX in PHH. CA-CB-DEX had much weaker inhibitory effects than DEX on endotoxin-induced cytokines in mouse macrophages and human whole blood. In contrast, CA-CB-DEX exerted more potent anti-inflammatory effects than DEX in livers of septic mice. Conclusions: CA-CB-DEX demonstrated good hepatocyte-selectivity in vitro and better anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Further test of CA-CB-DEX as a novel liver-targeting GC prodrug for inflammatory liver diseases and sepsis is warranted.

N2  - Three-dimensional (3D) modeling of trees has many applications in various areas, such as forest and urban planning, forest health monitoring, and carbon sequestration, to name a few. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry has recently emerged as a low cost, rapid, and accurate method for 3D modeling of urban and forest trees replacing the costly traditional methods such as plot measurements and surveying. There are numerous commercial and open-source software programs available, each processing UAV data differently to generate forest 3D modeling and photogrammetric products, including point clouds, Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Canopy Height Models (CHMs), and orthophotos in forest areas. The objective of this study is to compare the three widely-used commercial software packages, namely, AgiSoft Photoscan (Metashape) V 1.7.3, PIX4DMapper (Pix4D) V 4.4.12, and DJI Terra V 3.7.6 for processing UAV data over forest areas from three perspectives: point cloud density and reconstruction quality, computational time, DSM assessment for height accuracy (z) and ability of tree detection on DSM. Three datasets, captured by UAVs on the same day at three different flight altitudes, were used in this study. The first, second, and third datasets were collected at altitudes of 60 m, 100 m, and 120 m, respectively over a forested area in Tully, New York. While the first and third datasets were taken horizontally, the second dataset was taken 20 degrees off-nadir to investigate the impact of oblique images. Results show that Pix4D and AgiSoft generate 2.5 times denser point clouds than DJI Terra. However, reconstruction quality evaluation using the Iterative Closest Point method (ICP) shows DJI Terra has fewer gaps in the point cloud and performed better than AgiSoft and Pix4D in generating a point cloud of trees, power lines and poles despite producing a fewer number of points. In other words, the outperformance in key points detection and an improved matching algorithm are key factors in generating improved final products. The computational time comparison demonstrates that the processing time for AgiSoft and DJI Terra is roughly half that of Pix4D. Furthermore, DSM elevation profiles demonstrate that the estimated height variations between the three software range from 0.5 m to 2.5 m. DJI Terra's estimated heights are generally greater than those of AgiSoft and Pix4D. Furthermore, DJI Terra outperforms AgiSoft and Pix4D for modeling the height contour of trees, buildings, and power lines and poles, followed by AgiSoft and Pix4D. Finally, in terms of the ability of tree detection, DJI Terra outperforms AgiSoft and Pix4D in generating a comprehensive DSM as a result of fewer gaps in the point cloud. Consequently, it stands out as the preferred choice for tree detection applications. The results of this paper can help 3D model users to have confidence in the reliability of the generated 3D models by comprehending the accuracy of the employed software.

N2  - The U.S. National Park Service uses W126 to assess critical levels of ozone (O3) exposure to sensitive plant species, whereas the scientific community considers the stomatal flux-based metric, phytotoxic O3 dose (POD), more relevant in foliar risk evaluation. This study found a decreasing trend of 0.15 ppm-hrs/yr (p = 0.049) in W126 at a Yellowstone National Park monitoring site during 1997–2021 and no trend at a Grand Teton National Park site over 2012–2021 but no trends at both sites in POD calculated following the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) (2017). To evaluate the CLRTAP (2017) method, 2019 summer POD was calculated for comparison using the Big-leaf model and was found 20%–100% less than the CLRTAP (2017)-calculated leaf-level one already, let alone compared to the latter scaled up to canopy-level, owing to the much smaller stomatal O3 flux (SOF) estimates under most conditions. Further analysis revealed exceptions where larger SOF values (>0.02 mmol/m2/hr), obtained from using the Big-leaf model with measured sensible heat and water vapor flux included in input, were not captured by the CLRTAP (2017) method and the Big-leaf model with input of regular meteorological variables only. Those large SOF values resulted under cooler, less windy, more humid, and cloudier conditions, when the approximate water vapor concentration difference between the ambient and leaf saturation level was found <1 mol/m3. A multivariate function was developed, through machine learning, by regressing SOF on air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, phytosynthetically active radiation, and O3 concentration. Its testing and evaluation demonstrated improved estimates of the large variability in SOF. This new parameterization showed promising capability of assessing critical levels of O3 exposure in park management, and it could be further improved with long-term flux measurement data becoming available and evapotranspiration better represented.

N2  - Background: The public health response to COVID-19 has shifted to reducing deaths and hospitalizations to prevent overwhelming health systems. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in wastewater are known to correlate with clinical data including cases and hospital admissions for COVID-19. We developed and tested a predictive model for incident COVID-19 hospital admissions in New York State using wastewater data. Methods: Using county-level COVID-19 hospital admissions and wastewater surveillance covering 13.8 million people across 56 counties, we fit a generalized linear mixed model predicting new hospital admissions from wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from April 29, 2020 to June 30, 2022. We included covariates such as COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the county, comorbidities, demographic variables, and holiday gatherings. Findings: Wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA correlated with new hospital admissions per 100,000 up to ten days prior to admission. Models that included wastewater had higher predictive power than models that included clinical cases only, increasing the accuracy of the model by 15%. Predicted hospital admissions correlated highly with observed admissions (r = 0.77) with an average difference of 0.013 hospitalizations per 100,000 (95% CI = [0.002, 0.025]) Interpretation: Using wastewater to predict future hospital admissions from COVID-19 is accurate and effective with superior results to using case data alone. The lead time of ten days could alert the public to take precautions and improve resource allocation for seasonal surges.

N2  - Purpose/Objective(s): To automate the digitization of plastic and titanium applicators used in interstitial and hybrid gynecological (GYN) computed tomography (CT)-based high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy procedures to accelerate the planning and reduce the potential for planning errors. Our hypothesis is that artificial intelligence can accurately automate the identification and digitization of plastic and titanium applicators used in HDR brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: Forty-eight patients who had received GYN procedures (7 tandem/ring: plastic applicators, 41 interstitial: titanium needles) were selected retrospectively. Patients were randomly split into training (n = 40) and test (n = 8) sets for this study. DICOM images and digitized needles from delivered plans were converted to 3D binary format. The points from each needle were transformed to individual contours and combined into a single binary mask using custom software. Using nnU-Net, a self-configuring deep convolutional neural network, 2D and 3D U-Net architectures were trained and ensembled. With the CT image as input, the nnU-Net model learned features to automatically segment the needle contours. Lastly, a 3D U-Net model was trained using 5 of the 7 tandem/ring cases (plastic applicators), with two reserved to evaluate this automated digitization. The models’ performance was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and identification rate for individual needles. Results: The model trained on 40 patients performed well on titanium needle cases [mean (+/- std. dev.) DSC = 0.738+/-0.034], but did not perform well on the tandem/ring cases [DSC = 0.408] in the test set. This model automatically identified 100% (54 out of 54) titanium needles but missed all plastic applicators from tandem/ring cases. Training a model with only a limited number of tandem/ring (plastic applicators) cases greatly improved segmentation accuracy [mean DSC = 0.646] for tandem/ring test cases. This model which was trained using only tandem/ring cases, automatically identified 7 out of 7 needles (100% vs 0% with previous model) from cases in the test set. Conclusion: The nnU-Net can automatically detect HDR needles with high confidence. Using applicator-specific identification models may improve digitization accuracy. Further evaluation of these tools on larger datasets will confirm the findings of this study.

N2  - Objectives: Automated EKG interpretation software has long been deemed inferior to physician interpretation. With improvements in software technology, namely machine learning, there is increasing evidence of both non inferior and superiority studies in software interpretation's favor. These advances in automated software technology have great potential to improve EKG interpretation accuracy, patient care, and emergency department efficiency. We aimed to analyze our current automated EKG interpretation software against emergency medicine physician interpretation in cases of STEMI as compared to cardiac catheterization results. Methods: We identified all patients presenting to the emergency department who had a STEMI code activation and subsequently received cardiac catheterization between 2021 - 2022. Automated software interpretation of the EKG, emergency physician interpretation, and cardiac catheterization results for accuracy of the diagnoses of STEMI were compared. Results: In total there were 87 STEMI activations from the SUNY Upstate Emergency Department confirmed by cardiology on catheterization. We found that 60.9% (53) of the cases were interpreted as STEMI by both the software and the emergency physician. Software did not interpret a STEMI in 35.6% (31) of the cases where the emergency physician did indicate STEMI. In 2 cases neither the automated software nor physician interpreted STEMI and in 1 case only automated software interpreted STEMI. The automated software had a 62.07% sensitivity in detecting a STEMI. Sensitivity of emergency physician interpretation at our institution was significantly greater at 96.55%. Conclusions: The current automated software utilized for EKG interpretation is inferior for interpretation of STEMI EKGs as compared to cardiac catheterization results. Emergency physician EKG interpretation for STEMI was more accurate than the automated software when compared to cardiac catheterization. No, authors do not have interests to disclose

N2  - Background: Classification models using genetic data in ADHD do not perform as well as expected given the high heritability of the disorder. One possibility in improving performance is better using the accumulated knowledge about the genome to help machine learning models find patterns among the disorder's heterogeneous and complex genetic architecture. Methods: In a study of 2,455 people with ADHD and 8,432 without ADHD across 9 cohorts, we collected and calculated genomic annotations related to the functional and structural qualities of each genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism. We used this genomic context alongside genotype data as input into a convolutional neural network models aiming to predict ADHD diagnosis. We implemented an adversarial ancestry task, which forces the model to unlearn features that would otherwise be helpful in predicting ancestry, to test within-model ancestry adjustment. We used additional adversarial tasks to test hypotheses on the differences between models with and without genomic context. Results: Using the same methods in type 2 diabetes, a neural network using genotype data (AUC: 0.66) and a convolutional neural network using context informed genotype data (AUC: 0.65) both outperformed a polygenic risk score approach (AUC: 0.57). Adversarial ancestry tasks effectively eliminated the predictability of ancestry without changing model performance. Analyses are underway in ADHD and will be compared to previous results in the same dataset where a gene set polygenic risk score model had an AUC of 0.72, a traditional PRS model had an AUC of 0.62, and a PRS-CS model had an AUC of 0.66. Discussion: Our current results suggest that context informed genotype models can find novel risk features. They also suggest that enriching machine learning models with annotation rich genotype data is useful in improving classification performance. Adversarial ancestry adjustment can effectively adjust for ancestry within each model and report any remaining ability of the model to use ancestry as a predictor.

N2  - Objectives: One obstacle to the use of nonstimulant medications is that it typically requires 6 to 8 weeks of treatment to decide if the patient will respond sufficiently. The goal of this work was to determine if we could develop a clinically feasible algorithm to predict response to a nonstimulant medication for ADHD (extended-release viloxazine [VER]) early in the course of treatment. Methods: We used data from 4 phase-3 placebo-controlled trials of 100- to 600-mg/day VER in youth and 1 in adults. Treatment response was defined as ≥50% reduction in change from baseline (CFB) in ADHD symptoms at week 6. Predictor variables were: Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score at weeks 1, 2, and 3; target dose; and baseline age, body weight, and BMI. Five machine learning methods were tested: support vector machines; K-nearest neighbors; lasso regression; and random forests, gradient boosting machine, and their ensemble. Results: The Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) analysis found that the lasso regression was the best fitting model. ROC AUC for each model increased with increasing the number of weeks of data. Model results were described with an algorithm based on the CGI-I, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice. Conclusions: The course of clinical improvement 2 weeks after initiation of treatment can be used to select which patients are likely to benefit from continued treatment with VER. ADHD, PPC, MDM

N2  - Objectives: Genomewide association studies highlight the polygenic nature of neuropsychiatric conditions, meaning that risk is conferred by thousands of variants of small effect. In other fields of medicine, scores based on an individual’s relative burden of disease-associated alleles, or polygenic risk scores (PRS), are showing promise for risk stratification and personalized care. In child and adolescent psychiatry, the utility of PRS in clinical practice is a growing conversation. We will report on the ability for PRS to predict child psychopathology, considering specificity and sex-dependent effects, as well as ways to refine risk models with biologically relevant information, machine learning, and environmental data. Methods: Jennifer Crosbie, PhD, will discuss the association of PRS for ADHD and MDD with dimensions of a cross-diagnostic trait, irritability, in children and adolescents from the community (n = 1062). Alysa Doyle, PhD, will report analyses investigating whether PRS for ADHD, MDD, and anxiety disorder (ANX) show evidence of specificity and sex-dependent effects in child and adolescent psychiatry outpatients (n = 1078). Eric Barnett, PhD, will describe machine learning strategies used to create gene-set PRS based on ADHD and related phenotypes in a sample of 10,887 participants. Michael Mooney, PhD, will report on the additive and interactive effects of PRS for several common mental illnesses with environmental factors (eg, air pollution, family conflict) on associations with ADHD symptoms in population-based (n = 1876) and clinic samples (n = 1449). Results: ADHD PRS was associated with externalizing dimensions of irritability, whereas MDD PRS was associated with all dimensions of irritability. ADHD and ANX PRS showed some features of specificity to relevant conditions, while MDD risk did not associate with relevant phenotypes. There were no sex-dependent effects. PRS based on gene-sets as well as genetic risk for disorders genetically correlated with ADHD improved prediction of ADHD compared to standard ADHD PRS. PRS across psychiatric conditions and environmental factors had additive effects for ADHD symptoms but no evidence for PRS by environment interactions. Conclusions: PRS show evidence of prediction in youth samples that have implications for their eventual clinical application. ADHD, DDD, IMD

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of our study is to build predictive and informative machine learning models that can accurately classify people with and without ADHD and to improve our understanding of the disorder’s genomic risk architecture. Methods: In a study of 10,887 participants across 9 cohorts, we performed gene set analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to select gene sets associated with ADHD within a training subset. For each gene set, we generated gene set polygenic risk scores (gsPRS), which sum the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each selected gene set. We created gsPRS for ADHD and for phenotypes having a high genetic correlation with ADHD. These gsPRS were added to the standard polygenic risk score (PRS) as input to random forest models predicting ADHD. We tested biological relevance of gsPRS by comparing random forest feature importance scores to relative gene set expression in the brain. Results: For a test subset that had not been used for training or optimization, a random forest model that included gsPRS and PRS as input had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.70-0.74). This AUC was a statistically significant improvement over models that included only PRS and models that used the same features but only accounted for additive risk. The feature importance scores of gsPRS were significantly positively correlated with gene set expression in the brain relative to all other tissue types. Conclusions: Summing risk at the gene set level and incorporating genetic risk from disorders with high genetic correlation with ADHD improved the accuracy of predicting ADHD. These prediction improvements over models that do not include gsPRS suggest that better accounting of genetic risk and the genetic context of allelic differences result in more predictive models. Learning curves suggest that additional improvements would be expected with larger study sizes. Prediction improvements over models that only account for additive risk suggest that nonadditive risk is present at the gene set level and useful for ADHD prediction. Although our results suggest that it is possible to predict ADHD using a patient’s genetic information, further improvements will likely be necessary for clinical utility. We are investigating methods that aim to improve upon this work and progress toward clinically useful genetic risk models. ADHD, GS, RF

N2  - Introduction:Machine learning methods have emerged as objective tools to evaluate operative performance in urological procedures. Our objectives were to establish machine learning-based methods for predicting surgeon caseload for nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using our validated hydrogel-based simulation platform and identify potential metrics of surgical expertise.Methods:Video, robotic kinematics, and force sensor data were collected from 35 board-certified urologists at the 2022 AUA conference. Video was annotated for surgical gestures. Objective performance indicators were derived from robotic system kinematic data. Force metrics were calculated from hydrogel model integrated sensors. Data were fitted to 3 supervised machine learning models - logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors - which were used to predict procedure-specific learning curve proficiency. Recursive feature elimination was used to optimize the best performing model.Results:Logistic regression predicted caseload with the highest AUC score for 5/7 possible data combinations (force, 64%; objective performance indicators + gestures, 94%; objective performance indicators + force, 90%; gestures + force, 93%; objective performance indicators + gestures + force, 94%). Support vector machine predicted the highest AUC score for objective performance indicators (82%) and gestures (94%). Logistic regression with recursive feature elimination was the most effective model reaching 96% AUC in predicting case-specific experience. Most contributory features were identified across all model types.Conclusions:We have created a machine learning-based algorithm utilizing a novel combination of objective performance indicators, gesture analysis, and integrated force metrics to predict surgical experience, capable of discriminating between surgeons with low or high robot-assisted radical prostatectomy caseload with 96% AUC in a standardized, simulation-based environment.

N2  - The differentiation of dengue virus (DENV) infection, a major cause of acute febrile illness in tropical regions, from other etiologies, may help prioritize laboratory testing and limit the inappropriate use of antibiotics. While traditional clinical prediction models focus on individual patient-level parameters, we hypothesize that for infectious diseases, population-level data sources may improve predictive ability. To create a clinical prediction model that integrates patient-extrinsic data for identifying DENV among febrile patients presenting to a hospital in Thailand, we fit random forest classifiers combining clinical data with climate and population-level epidemiologic data. In cross validation, compared to a parsimonious model with the top clinical predictors, a model with the addition of climate data, reconstructed susceptibility estimates, force of infection estimates, and a recent case clustering metric, significantly improved model performance.

N2  - Objectives: There is an increase in gastrointestinal (GI) distress incidences among young adults. According to a 2020 study, one-third of their student cohort aged between 18–25 experienced at least one severe GI symptom. It is commonly understood that those who wake up from their GI symptoms are more likely to exhibit a pathologic gastrointestinal disease. Symptoms to look for GI illness include heartburn/reflux, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea/vomiting. College students are also known to lead an unhealthy lifestyle from a poor diet to substance use. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to look into the different lifestyle factors that are associated with GI distress, particularly those who exhibit sleep disturbances as this can be a red flag pointing towards pathological disease. Methods: An anonymous survey was distributed on social media platforms targeting US college students. Inclusion criteria were college students between the age of 18–25. Demographic questions included gender, age, academic class, and race. Lifestyle factors questions assessed diet and sleep quality, exercise level, social life and substance use. GI pertaining questions assessed whether respondents suffer from GI distress and types. Data was analyzed using a data mining technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to identify patterns. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett sphericity tests were performed to verify that the data was suitable for PCA analysis. The scree plot was used to identify the number of components with the highest variance. All data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Results: A total of 912 respondents completed the survey. KMO value r=0.635, with significance <0.001. Four different components were identified: Substance use and waking up at night from symptoms (accounting for 10.352% of the variance), probiotic/antibiotic use and GI symptoms (accounting for 9.994% of the variance), Unhealthy diet and sleep disturbances (accounting for 8.663% of the variance), and eating and stress (accounting for 7.997% of the variance). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a statistically significant relationship among various lifestyle factors, including diet and psychosocial associations. This prompts the need for more research to learn more about this increasing prevalence of GI distress among young adults. Funding Sources: None.

N2  - Animal activity patterns are highly variable and influenced by internal and external factors, including social processes. Quantifying activity patterns in natural settings can be challenging, as it is difficult to monitor animals over long time periods. Here, we developed and validated a machine-learning based classifier to identify behavioural states from accelerometer data of wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), social carnivores that live in large fission-fusion societies. By combining this classifier with continuous collar-based accelerometer data from five hyenas, we generated a complete record of activity patterns over more than one month. We used these continuous behavioural sequences to investigate how past activity, individual idiosyncrasies, and social synchronisation influence hyena activity patterns. We found that hyenas exhibit characteristic crepuscular-nocturnal daily activity patterns. Time spent active was independent of activity level on previous days, suggesting that hyenas do not show activity compensation. We also found limited evidence for an effect of individual identity on activity, and showed that pairs of hyenas who spent more time together synchronised their activity patterns. This study sheds light on the patterns and drivers of activity in spotted hyena societies, and also provides a useful tool for quantifying behavioural sequences from accelerometer data.

N2  - Statistical modeling is generally meant to describe patterns in data in service of the broader scientific goal of developing theories to explain those patterns. Statistical models support meaningful inferences when models are built so as to align parameters of the model with potential causal mechanisms and how they manifest in data. When statistical models are instead based on assumptions chosen by default, attempts to draw inferences can be uninformative or even paradoxical—in essence, the tail is trying to wag the dog. These issues are illustrated by van Doorn et al. (this issue) in the context of using Bayes Factors to identify effects and interactions in linear mixed models. We show that the problems identified in their applications (along with other problems identified here) can be circumvented by using priors over inherently meaningful units instead of default priors on standardized scales. This case study illustrates how researchers must directly engage with a number of substantive issues in order to support meaningful inferences, of which we highlight two: The first is the problem of coordination, which requires a researcher to specify how the theoretical constructs postulated by a model are functionally related to observable variables. The second is the problem of generalization, which requires a researcher to consider how a model may represent theoretical constructs shared across similar but non-identical situations, along with the fact that model comparison metrics like Bayes Factors do not directly address this form of generalization. For statistical modeling to serve the goals of science, models cannot be based on default assumptions, but should instead be based on an understanding of their coordination function and on how they represent causal mechanisms that may be expected to generalize to other related scenarios.

N2  - Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment through blood component sampling by liquid biopsies (LBs) is increasingly being investigated in myeloid malignancies. Blood components then undergo molecular analysis by flow cytometry or sequencing techniques and can be used as a powerful tool for prognostic and predictive purposes in myeloid malignancies. There is evidence and more is evolving about the quantification and identification of cell-based and gene-based biomarkers in myeloid malignancies to monitor treatment response. MRD based acute myeloid leukemia protocol and clinical trials are currently incorporating LB testing and preliminary results are encouraging for potential widespread use in clinic in the near future. MRD monitoring using LBs are not standard in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) but this is an area of active investigation. In the future, LBs can replace more invasive techniques such as bone marrow biopsies. However, the routine clinical application of these markers continues to be an issue due to lack of standardization and limited number of studies investigating their specificities. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) could help simplify the complex interpretation of molecular testing and reduce errors related to operator dependency. Though the field is rapidly evolving, the applicability of MRD testing using LB is mostly limited to research setting at this time due to the need for validation, regulatory approval, payer coverage, and cost issues. This review focuses on the types of biomarkers, most recent research exploring MRD and LB in myeloid malignancies, ongoing clinical trials, and the future of LB in the setting of AI.

N2  - Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment using peripheral blood instead of bone marrow aspirate/biopsy specimen or the biopsy of the cancerous infiltrated by lymphoid malignancies is an emerging technique with enormous interest of research and technological innovation at the current time. In some lymphoid malignancies (particularly ALL), Studies have shown that MRD monitoring of the peripheral blood may be an adequate alternative to frequent BM aspirations. However, additional studies investigating the biology of liquid biopsies in ALL and its potential as an MRD marker in larger patient cohorts in treatment protocols are warranted. Despite the promising data, there are still limitations in liquid biopsies in lymphoid malignancies, such as standardization of the sample collection and processing, determination of timing and duration for liquid biopsy analysis, and definition of the biological characteristics and specificity of the techniques evaluated such as flow cytometry, molecular techniques, and next generation sequencies. The use of liquid biopsy for detection of minimal residual disease in T-cell lymphoma is still experimental but it has made significant progress in multiple myeloma for example. Recent attempt to use artificial intelligence may help simplify the algorithm for testing and may help avoid inter-observer variation and operator dependency in these highly technically demanding testing process.

N2  - Background. Literature and data mining found abnormal induction of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) and CXCL8 and down-regulation of CXCL2 in inflammatory liver diseases. This study was performed to understand the glucocorticoid receptor's (GR's) effects on chemokine and acute-phase protein expression in human liver, in settings of bacterial infection (modeled using LPS) or inflammation (modeled using TNFα). Methods. Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were treated with combinations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h, following which chemokine mRNA and protein expression were analyzed using qPCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays. Dual luciferase assays were performed on transfected cell lines. Mutant CXCL2 promoters were used in dual luciferase assays to identify specific regions of the CXCL2 promoter affected by GR, TNFα, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, a liver-enriched transcription factor). Results. In PHH from donor 1, GR strongly inhibited LPS-induced CXCL1 and CXCL8 translation and transcription, whereas CXCL2 transcription tended to increase with DEX treatment. In PHH from donor 2, DEX treatment inhibited protein expression and secretion of CXCL1 and CXCL8 induced by TNFα and/or LPS, whereas CXCL2 upregulation was largely unaffected by DEX treatment. In nonliver HEK293T cells GR activity inhibited CXCL2 promoter activity. However, in liver-derived HEPG2 cells, GR induced CXCL2 promoter activity. A 407-base pair region upstream of CXCL2 promoter is necessary for full GR functionality in HEPG2 cells. TNFα synergized with HNF4α in inducing CXCL2 promoter activity in HEPG2 cells. Conclusions. GR's effects on chemokine expression are cell-type specific and chemokine specific. GR down-regulated CXCL1 and CXCL8 in different cell types, whereas the specific activation of CXCL2 in hepatocytes and down-regulation of CXCL2 in nonhepatocytes by GR appears due to cell-specific utilization of CXCL2 promoter. By specifically increasing GR activity in the liver, we may normalize chemokine imbalances and prevent sepsis in inflammatory liver diseases.

N2  - A popular approach to reduce the high dimensionality resulting from genome-wide association studies is to analyze a whole pathway in a single test for association with a phenotype. Kernel machine regression (KMR) is a highly flexible pathway analysis approach. Initially, KMR was developed to analyze a simple phenotype with just one measurement per individual. Recently, however, the investigation into the influence of genomic factors in the development of disease-related phenotypes across time (trajectories) has gained in importance. Thus, novel statistical approaches for KMR analyzing longitudinal data, i.e. several measurements at specific time points per individual are required. For longitudinal pathway analysis, we extend KMR to long-KMR using the estimation equivalence of KMR and linear mixed models. We include additional random effects to correct for the dependence structure. Moreover, within long-KMR we created a topology-based pathway analysis by combining this approach with a kernel including network information of the pathway. Most importantly, long-KMR not only allows for the investigation of the main genetic effect adjusting for time dependencies within an individual, but it also allows to test for the association of the pathway with the longitudinal course of the phenotype in the form of testing the genetic time-interaction effect. The approach is implemented as an R package, kalpra. Our simulation study demonstrates that the power of long-KMR exceeded that of another KMR method previously developed to analyze longitudinal data, while maintaining (slightly conservatively) the type I error. The network kernel improved the performance of long-KMR compared to the linear kernel. Considering different pathway densities, the power of the network kernel decreased with increasing pathway density. We applied long-KMR to cognitive data on executive function (Trail Making Test, part B) from the PsyCourse Study and 17 candidate pathways selected from Reactome. We identified seven nominally significant pathways.

N2  - Common fragile sites (CFSs) are specific regions of all individuals’ genome that are predisposed to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and undergo subsequent rearrangements. CFS formation can be induced in vitro by mild level of DNA replication stress, such as DNA polymerase inhibition or nucleotide pool disturbance. The mechanisms of CFS formation have been linked to DNA replication timing control, transcription activities, as well as chromatin organization. However, it is unclear what specific cis- or trans-factors regulate the interplay between replication and transcription that determine CFS formation. We recently reported genome-wide mapping of DNA DSBs under replication stress induced by aphidicolin in human lymphoblastoids for the first time. Here, we systematically compared these DSBs with regards to nearby epigenomic features mapped in the same cell line from published studies. We demonstrate that aphidicolin-induced DSBs are strongly correlated with histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation, a marker for active transcription. We further demonstrate that this DSB signature is a composite effect by the dual treatment of aphidicolin and its solvent, dimethylsulfoxide, the latter of which potently induces transcription on its own. We also present complementing evidence for the association between DSBs and 3D chromosome architectural domains with high density gene cluster and active transcription. Additionally, we show that while DSBs were detected at all but one of the fourteen finely mapped CFSs, they were not enriched in the CFS core sequences and rather demarcated the CFS core region. Related to this point, DSB density was not higher in large genes of greater than 300 kb, contrary to reported enrichment of CFS sites at these large genes. Finally, replication timing analyses demonstrate that the CFS core region contain initiation events, suggesting that altered replication dynamics are responsible for CFS formation in relatively higher level of replication stress.

N2  - Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy treatment plans have recently utilized deep learning methods to automatically contour organs at risk (OAR). In this study, we use an open-source framework, Medical Open Network for AI (MONAI), and the 3D U-Net network to automatically segment head and neck OAR structures. This study shows that using pre-processing medical image transformations improves performance of auto-contouring. Materials/Methods: This study used the MONAI deep learning framework to create 28 distinct segmentation models for head and neck OAR structures from a dataset of manually contoured structure sets from CT simulation images. The MONAI framework integrated pre-processing transforms included image windowing, pixel resampling, foreground cropping, and random crop patching that was performed on the training sets prior to model training. Model training was performed using a 3D U-Net algorithm. Mean dice similarity coefficients were computed for each OAR deep learning model. Results: The training was conducted on a single institution's dataset composed of 609 unique OAR structure sets. Select mean dice similarity coefficients achieved in the auto-contouring model's validation sets ranged as high as 0.906, 0.804, and 0.775 for the orbit, submandibular gland, and thyroid respectively. Conclusion: We trained a series of deep convolutional neural network models that perform automated contouring of head and neck OAR with a high degree of accuracy, outperforming other models to date. The models were trained using the open-source MONAI framework that is easily accessible and customizable to anyone in radiation oncology. The utility of medically specific image transformations available within MONAI allow for improved model performance and generalizability, and similar techniques could be employed in future studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Head Start 4 is a randomized clinical trial to determine whether dose-intensive tandem consolidation, compared with a single cycle, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell rescue provides a survival benefit in pediatric patients with medulloblastoma or other embryonal tumors. The trial incorporates upfront molecular subgrouping and non-mandatory, prospective blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection. This pilot study aimed to identify exosomal non-coding RNAs (exo-ncRNAs) that might serve as novel diagnostic and/or treatment response biomarkers. METHODS: CSF(1-2mLs) from 11 controls (nontumor) and 27 medulloblastoma participants including 23 obtained at baseline, 22 at the end of induction, 3 post-consolidation, and 4 relapse time points, were profiled. Exosome isolation and small RNA-sequencing were performed by System Biosciences. Differential gene expression (DGE) was performed in R (DESeq2). Variations in gene expression profiles between samples were visualized using principal component analysis. RESULTS: After limiting to ncRNAs with expression of 2 counts per million in 50% or more of the samples in each comparison, ∼9,500 ncRNAs were detected. DGE analyses revealed 118 ncRNAs with log2 fold change(FC) >2 and 1 ncRNA with log2FC< -2 in baseline CSF samples compared to controls. In contrast, 11 ncRNAs(log2FC >2) and 1 ncRNA(log2FC< -2) were detected in end of induction CSF samples compared to controls. Comparing end of induction to baseline CSF samples accounting for paired samples, 0 ncRNAs(log2FC >2) and 52 ncRNAs(log2FC< -2) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that exosomal small RNA-sequencing of limited CSF volumes is feasible. Differential expression and distinct clustering between tumor baseline samples compared to non-tumor controls was observed. CSF-derived exo-ncRNAs at end of induction also demonstrated “normalization” of ncRNA profiles, signifying CSF biomarkers may serve a role in diagnosis and molecular response assessment. A comprehensive analysis including multi-marker predictive model development and molecular subgrouping will be undertaken at completion of study enrollment.

N2  - Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, and around two-thirds of affected children report persisting problems in adulthood. This negative trajectory is associated with high comorbidity with disorders like obesity, depression, or substance use disorder (SUD). Decreases in cortical volume and thickness have also been reported in depression, SUD, and obesity, but it is unclear whether structural brain alterations represent unique disorder-specific profiles. A transdiagnostic exploration of ADHD and typical comorbid disorders could help to understand whether specific morphometric brain changes are due to ADHD or, alternatively, to the comorbid disorders. In the current study, we studied the brain morphometry of 136 subjects with ADHD with and without comorbid depression, SUD, and obesity to test whether there are unique or common brain alterations. We employed a machine-learning-algorithm trained to classify subjects with ADHD in the large ENIGMA-ADHD dataset and used it to predict the diagnostic status of subjects with ADHD and/or comorbidities. The parcellation analysis demonstrated decreased cortical thickness in medial prefrontal areas that was associated with presence of any comorbidity. However, these results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Similarly, the machine learning analysis indicated that the predictive algorithm grouped most of our ADHD participants as belonging to the ADHD-group, but no systematic differences between comorbidity status came up. In sum, neither a classical comparison of segmented structural brain metrics nor an ML model based on the ADHD ENIGMA data differentiate between ADHD with and without comorbidities. As the ML model is based in part on adolescent brains, this might indicate that comorbid disorders and their brain changes are not captured by the ML model because it represents a different developmental brain trajectory.

N2  - Cells rely on their cytoskeleton for key processes including division and directed motility. Actin filaments are a primary constituent of the cytoskeleton. Although actin filaments can create a variety of network architectures linked to distinct cell functions, the microscale molecular interactions that give rise to these macroscale structures are not well understood. In this work, we investigate the microscale mechanisms that produce different branched actin network structures using an iterative classification approach. First, we employ a simple yet comprehensive agent-based model that produces synthetic actin networks with precise control over the microscale dynamics. Then we apply machine learning techniques to classify actin networks based on measurable network density and geometry, identifying key mechanistic processes that lead to particular branched actin network architectures. Extensive computational experiments reveal that the most accurate method uses a combination of supervised learning based on network density and unsupervised learning based on network symmetry. This framework can potentially serve as a powerful tool to discover the molecular interactions that produce the wide variety of actin network configurations associated with normal development as well as pathological conditions such as cancer.

N2  - Complex high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze are frequently produced through ‘-omics’ profiling. Typically, these datasets contain more genomic features than samples, limiting the use of multivariable statistical and machine learning-based approaches to analysis. Therefore, effective alternative approaches are urgently needed to identify features-of-interest in ‘-omics’ data. In this study, we present the molecular feature selection tool, a novel, ensemble-based, feature selection application for identifying candidate biomarkers in ‘-omics’ data. As proof-of-principle, we applied the molecular feature selection tool to identify a small set of immune-related genes as potential biomarkers of three prostate adenocarcinoma subtypes. Furthermore, we tested the selected genes in a model to classify the three subtypes and compared the results to models built using all genes and all differentially expressed genes. Genes identified with the molecular feature selection tool performed better than the other models in this study in all comparison metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using a significantly smaller set of genes. In addition, we developed a simple graphical user interface for the molecular feature selection tool, which is available for free download. This user-friendly interface is a valuable tool for the identification of potential biomarkers in gene expression datasets and is an asset for biomarker discovery studies.

N2  - Rationale Large-scale molecular analysis of ex vivo lung tissue is limited to a small number of study cohorts. Transcriptome imputation is a promising, non-invasive alternative for developing models of lung-tissue gene-expression. While existing methods like PrediXcan use common cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), we present the results of a novel transcriptomeimputation method called the Lung Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine (LungGENIE) that uses principal components from normalized blood gene-expression levels in a linear regression model to predict lung-tissue gene-expression. Methods Paired blood/lung RNA sequencing data from 347 donors from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were used to create and evaluate imputation performance of LungGENIE. Detailed procedures for tissue collection, library preparation, and sequencing have been published previously. Linear regression was trained to predict expression levels per gene using 20 principal components, which showed the best performance in another tissue type. Performance of LungGENIE was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. The metric of prediction performance was the coefficient of determination for observed and predicted expression levels (R2) in the hold-out fold. We compared the average cross-validation R2 prediction accuracies obtained by LungGENIE and PrediXcan. Statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.1.1). Results We identified 19,304 genes that were reliably predicted (R2 ≥ 0.01 and false-discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05). The median imputation accuracy for reliably imputed genes was Pearson's r=0.25, with an interquartile range of 0.19 to 0.32. We compared the cross-validation prediction accuracies between LungGENIE and PrediXcan (Figure 1). For the top 20 genes best predicted by LungGENIE, PrediXcan cross-validation prediction accuracies were higher for only 2 genes (Figure 1A). In contrast, for the top 20 genes best predicted by PrediXcan, there were no genes where LungGENIE had higher cross-validation prediction accuracies (Figure 1B). Conclusions LungGENIE is a novel computational method to predict lung-tissue gene-expression profiles based on observed peripheral-blood expression profiles. LungGENIE outperforms a popular, existing, genotype-based imputation method on predicting lung-tissue gene-expression for several genes. Further studies are needed to validate LungGENIE in independent paired blood-lung RNA sequencing datasets and explore its utility in detecting transcriptome signals in lung disease.

N2  - The rapid development of machine learning on acoustic signal processing has resulted in many solutions for detecting emotions from speech. Early works were developed for clean and acted speech and for a fixed set of emotions. Importantly, the datasets and solutions assumed that a person only exhibited one of these emotions. More recent work has continually been adding realism to emotion detection by considering issues such as reverberation, de-amplification, and background noise, but often considering one dataset at a time, and also assuming all emotions are accounted for in the model. We significantly improve realistic considerations for emotion detection by (i) more comprehensively assessing different situations by combining the five common publicly available datasets as one and enhancing the new dataset with data augmentation that considers reverberation and de-amplification, (ii) incorporating 11 typical home noises into the acoustics, and (iii) considering that in real situations a person may be exhibiting many emotions that are not currently of interest and they should not have to fit into a pre-fixed category nor be improperly labeled. Our novel solution combines CNN with out-of-data distribution detection. Our solution increases the situations where emotions can be effectively detected and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.

N2  - Background: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which sum the effects of SNPs throughout the genome to measure risk afforded by common genetic variants, have improved our ability to estimate disorder risk for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but the accuracy of risk prediction is rarely investigated. Methods: With the goal of improving risk prediction, we performed gene set analysis of GWAS data to select gene sets associated with ADHD within a training subset. For each selected gene set, we generated gene set polygenic risk scores (gsPRSs), which sum the effects of SNPs for each selected gene set. We created gsPRS for ADHD and for phenotypes having a high genetic correlation with ADHD. These gsPRS were added to the standard PRS as input to machine learning models predicting ADHD. We used feature importance scores to select gsPRS for a final model and to generate a ranking of the most consistently predictive gsPRS. Results: For a test subset that had not been used for training or validation, a random forest (RF) model using PRSs from ADHD and genetically correlated phenotypes and an optimized group of 20 gsPRS had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.70 – 0.74). This AUC was a statistically significant improvement over logistic regression models and RF models using only PRS from ADHD and genetically correlated phenotypes. Conclusions: Summing risk at the gene set level and incorporating genetic risk from disorders with high genetic correlations with ADHD improved the accuracy of predicting ADHD. Learning curves suggest that additional improvements would be expected with larger study sizes. Our study suggests that better accounting of genetic risk and the genetic context of allelic differences results in more predictive models.

N2  - Background: Many studies have been conducted with the goal of correctly predicting diagnostic status of a disorder using the combination of genetic data and machine learning. The methods of these studies often differ drastically. It is often hard to judge which components of a study led to better results and whether better reported results represent a true improvement or an uncorrected bias inflating performance. Methods: In this systematic review, we extracted information about the methods used and other differentiating features in genomic machine learning models. We used the extracted features in mixed-effects linear regression models predicting model performance. We tested for univariate and multivariate associations as well as interactions between features. Results: In univariate models the number of hyperparameter optimizations reported and data leakage due to feature selection were significantly associated with an increase in reported model performance. In our multivariate model, the number of hyperparameter optimizations, data leakage due to feature selection, and training size were significantly associated with an increase in reported model performance. The interaction between number of hyperparameter optimizations and training size as well as the interaction between data leakage due to optimization and training size were significantly associated reported model performance. Conclusions: Our results suggest that methods susceptible to data leakage are prevalent among genomic machine learning research, which may result in inflated reported performance. The interactions of these features with training size suggest that if data leakage susceptible methods continue to be used, modelling efforts using larger data sets may result in unexpectedly lower results compared to smaller data sets. Best practice guidelines that promote the avoidance and recognition of data leakage may help the field advance and avoid biased results.

N2  - Background: Clinicians want a more accurate diagnostic test to identify patients for prostate biopsy. We have previously described the development of a Luminex based test for aggressive prostate cancer (MiCheck). To facilitate widespread deployment of MiCheck on standard clinical chemistry analysers such as Roche Cobas and Abbott ARCHITECT/Alinity systems, we have performed additional analytical validation and model development using the MiCheck-01 clinical samples. A novel algorithm, termed MiCheck Prostate, was developed to differentiate aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason 3+4 or above) from non-aggressive (GS3+3) or no cancer patients. Methods: Serum protein biomarkers were measured in 317 samples from the MiCheck-01 clinical trial using either Luminex Multiplex kits, Abbott ARCHITECT or Beckmann Coulter systems. Logistic regression models were used to select best analytes, then Monte Carlo cross-validation was applied to avoid overfitting. A final model was selected from the cross-validation models with best test specificity at 95% sensitivity. The MiCheck-01 samples were later all measured on a standard Abbott ARCHITECT system using commercial ARCHITECT IVD tests. The best cross-validated model was developed and the results compared to those obtained from the mixed analyte platforms using ROC curve analysis. Results: The MiCheck Prostate algorithm was developed to maximise discrimination between aggressive prostate cancer and no cancer or non-aggressive cancer. The MiCheck Prostate algorithm reports a percentage risk of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. MiCheck Prostate is a logistic regression algorithm that combines three serum protein markers and one clinical factor and was derived using data from the MiCheck-01 trial. The algorithm gave an AUC of 0.82, with a 48% specificity at a 95% sensitivity cutpoint, with a negative predictive value of 94% for GS3+4 and higher cancers. The samples were later re-measured using all ARCHITECT immunoassays. Good correlations of each analyte across different measurement platforms was observed (Pearson's R > 0.9). The algorithm was revalidated using the new set of analyte values. AUC of 0.82 for the detection of aggressive CaP, and sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 47% were obtained for the best model, showing no statistical difference to the previous best model derived from the mixed platforms. NPV of 94% for GS3+4 or higher cancers was maintained. Conclusions: The MiCheck Prostate test shows high sensitivity, specificity and NPV for the detection of aggressive prostate cancer. It uses analytes widely available on standard clinical chemistry analysers such as Abbott Architect and Roche Cobas, hence is simple to deploy in the laboratory setting. Studies are ongoing to confirm the MiCheck Prostate algorithm performance using additional clinical sample cohorts.

N2  - Academic researchers, government agencies, industry groups, and individuals have produced forecasts at an unprecedented scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. To leverage these forecasts, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with an academic research lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to create the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Launched in April 2020, the Forecast Hub is a dataset with point and probabilistic forecasts of incident hospitalizations, incident cases, incident deaths, and cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 at national, state, and county levels in the United States. Included forecasts represent a variety of modeling approaches, data sources, and assumptions regarding the spread of COVID-19. The goal of this dataset is to establish a standardized and comparable set of short-term forecasts from modeling teams. These data can be used to develop ensemble models, communicate forecasts to the public, create visualizations, compare models, and inform policies regarding COVID-19 mitigation. These open-source data are available via download from GitHub, through an online API, and through R packages.

N2  - Background: We investigate whether deep learning (DL) neural networks can reduce erroneous human “judgment calls” on bedside echocardiograms and help distinguish Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) from anterior wall ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: We developed a single-channel (DCNN[2D SCI]), a multi-channel (DCNN[2D MCI]), and a 3-dimensional (DCNN[2D+t]) deep convolution neural network, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on 17,280 still-frame images and 540 videos from 2-dimensional echocardiograms in 10 years (1 January 2008 to 1 January 2018) retrospective cohort in University of Iowa (UI) and eight other medical centers. Echocardiograms from 450 UI patients were randomly divided into training and testing sets for internal training, testing, and model construction. Echocardiograms of 90 patients from the other medical centers were used for external validation to evaluate the model generalizability. A total of 49 board-certified human readers performed human-side classification on the same echocardiography dataset to compare the diagnostic performance and help data visualization. Findings: The DCNN (2D SCI), DCNN (2D MCI), DCNN(2D+t), and RNN models established based on UI dataset for TTS versus STEMI prediction showed mean diagnostic accuracy 73%, 75%, 80%, and 75% respectively, and mean diagnostic accuracy of 74%, 74%, 77%, and 73%, respectively, on the external validation. DCNN(2D+t) (area under the curve [AUC] 0·787 vs. 0·699, P = 0·015) and RNN models (AUC 0·774 vs. 0·699, P = 0·033) outperformed human readers in differentiating TTS and STEMI by reducing human erroneous judgement calls on TTS. Interpretation: Spatio-temporal hybrid DL neural networks reduce erroneous human “judgement calls” in distinguishing TTS from anterior wall STEMI based on bedside echocardiographic videos.

N2  - Objectives: Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which sum the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome to measure risk afforded by common genetic variants, have been used to estimate disorder risk for ADHD, but the accuracy of risk prediction is very low. Our goal was to improve the predictive accuracy of PRS using machine learning and to use the results to make inferences about the genetic architecture of ADHD and comorbid disorders. Methods: We performed gene set analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to select gene sets associated with ADHD within a training subset. For each selected gene set, we generated gene set PRS (gsPRS), which sum the effects of SNPs for each selected gene set. We created gsPRS for ADHD and for disorders having a high genetic correlation with ADHD. These gsPRS were added to the standard PRS as input to machine learning models predicting ADHD. We used feature importance scores to select gsPRS for a final model and to generate a ranking of the most consistently predictive gsPRS. Results: For a test subset that had not been used for training or validation, a random forest (RF) model had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.70-0.74). This AUC was a statistically significant improvement over logistic regression models using only traditional or modern PRS scoring methods, logistic regression, and RF models using PRS from ADHD and genetically related disorders. Conclusions: Summing risk at the gene set level and incorporating genetic risk from disorders with high genetic correlations with ADHD improved the accuracy of predicting ADHD. Learning curves suggest that additional improvements would be expected with larger study sizes. Our study suggests that better accounting of genetic risk and the genetic context of allelic differences results in more predictive models. ADHD, GS

N2  - MOTIVATION: Integrative multi-feature fusion analysis on biomedical data has gained much attention recently. In breast cancer, existing studies have demonstrated that combining genomic mRNA data and DNA methylation data can better stratify cancer patients with distinct prognosis than using single signature. However, those existing methods are simply combining these gene features in series and have ignored the correlations between separate omics dimensions over time. RESULTS: In the present study, we propose an adaptive multi-task learning method, which combines the Cox loss task with the ordinal loss task, for survival prediction of breast cancer patients using multi-modal learning instead of performing survival analysis on each feature dataset. First, we use local maximum quasi-clique merging (lmQCM) algorithm to reduce the mRNA and methylation feature dimensions and extract cluster eigengenes respectively. Then, we add an auxiliary ordinal loss to the original Cox model to improve the ability to optimize the learning process in training and regularization. The auxiliary loss helps to reduce the vanishing gradient problem for earlier layers and helps to decrease the loss of the primary task. Meanwhile, we use an adaptive weights approach to multi-task learning which weighs multiple loss functions by considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task. Finally, we build an ordinal cox hazards model for survival analysis and use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to predict patients' survival risk. We use the cross-validation method and the concordance index (C-index) for assessing the prediction effect. Stringent cross-verification testing processes for the benchmark dataset and two additional datasets demonstrate that the developed approach is effective, achieving very competitive performance with existing approaches.

N2  - Untargeted metabolomics via high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can reveal more than 100,000 molecular features in a single sample, many of which may represent unidentified metabolites, posing significant challenges to data analysis. We here introduce Metaboseek, an open-source analysis platform designed for untargeted comparative metabolomics and demonstrate its utility by uncovering biosynthetic functions of a conserved fat metabolism pathway, α-oxidation, using C. elegans as a model. Metaboseek integrates modules for molecular feature detection, statistics, molecular formula prediction, and fragmentation (MS/MS) analysis, which uncovered more than 200 previously uncharacterized α-oxidation-dependent metabolites in an untargeted comparison of wildtype and α-oxidation-defective hacl-1 mutants. The identified metabolites support the predicted enzymatic function of HACL-1 and revealed that α-oxidation participates in metabolism of endogenous β-methyl-branched fatty acids and food-derived cyclopropane lipids. Our results showcase compound discovery and feature annotation at scale via untargeted comparative metabolomics applied to a conserved primary metabolic pathway and suggest a model for the metabolism of cyclopropane lipids.

N2  - Sepsis is one of the main causes of death in critically ill patients. Despite the continuous development of medical technology in recent years, its morbidity and mortality are still high. This is mainly related to the delay in starting treatment and non-adherence of clinical guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an evolving field in medicine, which has been used to develop a variety of innovative Clinical Decision Support Systems. It has shown great potential in predicting the clinical condition of patients and assisting in clinical decision-making. AI-derived algorithms can be applied to multiple stages of sepsis, such as early prediction, prognosis assessment, mortality prediction, and optimal management. This review describes the latest literature on AI for clinical decision support in sepsis, and outlines the application of AI in the prediction, diagnosis, subphenotyping, prognosis assessment, and clinical management of sepsis. In addition, we discussed the challenges of implementing and accepting this non-traditional methodology for clinical purposes.

N2  - Background: Machine learning (ML) have been applied to brain MRI data to derive automated diagnosis, evaluation of disease status and treatment effects. However, the accuracies and sensitivities of classification models for psychiatric disorders are usually low and not yet suitable for clinical use, likely due to inadequate sample sizes. Secondly, brains structures form a complex and interconnect network, in which different disorders often selectively affect different parts of the network. Identification and extraction of these informative structures may help to improve the ML prediction performance. Methods: We describe deep learning methods, including autoencoder and multitask learning, in applications of diagnostic classifiers for ADHD and comorbid disorders. We applied autoencoders to a large combined mega-dataset, which includes 2271 ADHD and 1912 control subjects from the ENIGMA-ADHD cohort, 1833 ASD and 1814 Control subjects from the ENIGMA-ASD cohort, and 1629 self-reported healthy individuals from the Brain Imaging Genetics (BIG) study. Learned features were used to build a multi-task classification algorithm for ADHD And ASD diagnoses. Results: The large sample size of the mega-dataset produced better feature reconstruction with significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) than each individual cohort (p values <.0001). The learned latent features from the combined dataset were useful in improving diagnostic prediction accuracies (areas under the ROC curve) for ADHD and ASD. Conclusions: Leveraging large sample size from multiple datasets and the combination of innovative deep learning techniques, the classifiers can learn disease-relevant features for building better diagnostic classifiers.

N2  - Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is increasingly being incorporated into public health efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts, approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid, sensitive, and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters. In this study, we present an ultracentrifugation-based method for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA and use crAssphage, a bacteriophage specific to the human gut, to help account for RNA loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing. With these methods, we were able to detect, and sometimes quantify, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 mL wastewater samples within as little as 4.5 hours. Using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus RNA and deactivated SARS-CoV-2, we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7-12% of viral RNA using our method. Results from 24 sewersheds across Upstate New York during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater may be indicative of greater COVID-19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater RNA was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10,000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1.7%. crAssphage DNA concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied. After accounting for flow rate and population served, crAssphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1.35 × 1011 and 2.42 × 108 genome copies per day for DNA and RNA, respectively. A negative relationship between per capita crAssphage RNA and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of RNA over long transit times. Our results reinforce the potential for wastewater surveillance to be used as a tool to supplement understanding of infectious disease transmission obtained by traditional testing and highlight the potential for crAssphage co-detection to improve interpretations of wastewater surveillance data.

N2  - Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 90 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. A multi-model ensemble forecast that combined predictions from dozens of different research groups every week provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through October 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete forecasts of COVID-19 deaths consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Two-thirds of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naïve baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-week horizon 3-5 times larger than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.

N2  - There is a crucial need for quick testing and diagnosis of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lung ultrasound is an imaging modality that is cost-effective, widely accessible, and can be used to diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. It can be used to find important characteristics in the images, including A-lines, B-lines, consolidation, and pleural effusion, which all inform the clinician in monitoring and diagnosing the disease. With the use of portable ultrasound transducers, lung ultrasound images can be easily acquired, however, the images are often of poor quality. They often require an expert clinician interpretation, which may be time-consuming and is highly subjective. We propose a method for fast and reliable interpretation of lung ultrasound images by use of deep learning, based on the Kinetics-I3D network. Our learned model can classify an entire lung ultrasound scan obtained at point-of-care, without requiring the use of preprocessing or a frame-by-frame analysis. We compare our video classifier against ground truth classification annotations provided by a set of expert radiologists and clinicians, which include A-lines, B-lines, consolidation, and pleural effusion. Our classification method achieves an accuracy of 90% and an average precision score of 95% with the use of 5-fold cross-validation. The results indicate the potential use of automated analysis of portable lung ultrasound images to assist clinicians in screening and diagnosing patients.

N2  - Background: Suicide is a major public health concern globally. Accurately predicting suicidal behavior remains challenging. This study aimed to use machine learning approaches to examine the potential of the Swedish national registry data for prediction of suicidal behavior. Methods and findings: The study sample consisted of 541,300 inpatient and outpatient visits by 126,205 Swedenborn patients (54% female and 46% male) aged 18 to 39 (mean age at the visit: 27.3) years to psychiatric specialty care in Sweden between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. The most common psychiatric diagnoses at the visit were anxiety disorders (20.0%), major depressive disorder (16.9%), and substance use disorders (13.6%). A total of 425 candidate predictors covering demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), electronic medical records, criminality, as well as family history of disease and crime were extracted from the Swedish registry data. The sample was randomly split into an 80% training set containing 433,024 visits and a 20% test set containing 108,276 visits. Models were trained separately for suicide attempt/death within 90 and 30 days following a visit using multiple machine learning algorithms. Model discrimination and calibration were both evaluated. Among all eligible visits, 3.5% (18,682) were followed by a suicide attempt/death within 90 days and 1.7% (9,099) within 30 days. The final models were based on ensemble learning that combined predictions from elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and a neural network. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) on the test set were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.89) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90) for the outcome within 90 days and 30 days, respectively, both being significantly better than chance (i.e., AUC = 0.50) (p < 0.01). Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were reported at different risk thresholds. A limitation of our study is that our models have not yet been externally validated, and thus, the generalizability of the models to other populations remains unknown. Conclusions: By combining the ensemble method of multiple machine learning algorithms and high-quality data solely from the Swedish registers, we developed prognostic models to predict shortterm suicide attempt/death with good discrimination and calibration. Whether novel predictors can improve predictive performance requires further investigation.

N2  - Background: Suicide is a major public health concern globally. Accurately predicting suicidal behavior remains challenging. This study aimed to use machine learning approaches to examine the potential of the Swedish national registry data for prediction of suicidal behavior. Methods and findings: The study sample consisted of 541,300 inpatient and outpatient visits by 126,205 Swedenborn patients (54% female and 46% male) aged 18 to 39 (mean age at the visit: 27.3) years to psychiatric specialty care in Sweden between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012. The most common psychiatric diagnoses at the visit were anxiety disorders (20.0%), major depressive disorder (16.9%), and substance use disorders (13.6%). A total of 425 candidate predictors covering demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), electronic medical records, criminality, as well as family history of disease and crime were extracted from the Swedish registry data. The sample was randomly split into an 80% training set containing 433,024 visits and a 20% test set containing 108,276 visits. Models were trained separately for suicide attempt/death within 90 and 30 days following a visit using multiple machine learning algorithms. Model discrimination and calibration were both evaluated. Among all eligible visits, 3.5% (18,682) were followed by a suicide attempt/death within 90 days and 1.7% (9,099) within 30 days. The final models were based on ensemble learning that combined predictions from elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and a neural network. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) on the test set were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-0.89) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90) for the outcome within 90 days and 30 days, respectively, both being significantly better than chance (i.e., AUC = 0.50) (p < 0.01). Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were reported at different risk thresholds. A limitation of our study is that our models have not yet been externally validated, and thus, the generalizability of the models to other populations remains unknown. Conclusions: By combining the ensemble method of multiple machine learning algorithms and high-quality data solely from the Swedish registers, we developed prognostic models to predict shortterm suicide attempt/death with good discrimination and calibration. Whether novel predictors can improve predictive performance requires further investigation.

N2  - In vivo experimental analysis of human brain tissue poses substantial challenges and ethical concerns. We developed a novel method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE) that uses peripheral-blood transcriptomes to predict brain-tissue-specific gene-expression levels. BrainGENIE reliably predicted brain-tissue-specific expression levels for 1,733 - 11,569 genes (false-discovery rate-adjusted p<0.05), including many transcripts that cannot be predicted reliably by a transcriptome imputation method such as PrediXcan. We tested the generalizability of BrainGENIE in external within-individual data from ex vivo peripheral blood and postmortem brain samples from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, wherein we validated 39% of predicted gene expression levels as concordant with observed expression levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 23% in caudate. BrainGENIE recapitulated diagnosis-related gene expression changes in brain better than direct correlations from blood and predictions from PrediXcan. BrainGENIE complements and, in some ways, outperforms existing transcriptome-imputation tools, providing biologically meaningful predictions and opening new research avenues.

N2  - Machine learning (ML) has been applied to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diagnostic classifiers for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This systematic review examines this literature to clarify its clinical significance and to assess the implications of the various analytic methods applied. We found that, although most of studies reported the classification accuracies, they varied in choice of MRI modalities, ML models, cross-validation and testing methods, and sample sizes. We found that the accuracies of cross-validation methods inflated the performance estimation compared with those of a held-out test, compromising the model generalizability. Test accuracies have increased with publication year but were not associated with training sample sizes. Improved test accuracy over time was likely due to the use of better ML methods along with strategies to deal with data imbalances. Ultimately, large multi-modal imaging datasets, and potentially the combination with other types of data, like cognitive data and/or genetics, will be essential to achieve the goal of developing clinically useful imaging classification tools for ADHD in the future.

N2  - Many complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Efforts to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across human tissues by the GTEx Consortium and others have identified expression and splicing QTLs (eQTLs and sQTLs, respectively) for a majority of genes. However, these studies were largely performed with gene expression measurements from bulk tissue samples, thus obscuring the cellular specificity of genetic regulatory effects and in turn limiting their functional interpretation. Identifying the cell type (or types) in which a QTL is active will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of identifying cell type–specific QTLs from bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data by using computational estimates of cell type proportions. To date, such approaches have only been applied to a limited number of cell types and tissues. By applying this methodology to GTEx tissues for a diverse set of cell types, we aim to characterize the cellular specificity of genetic effects across human tissues and to describe the contribution of these effects to complex traits. RATIONALE: A growing number of in silico cell type deconvolution methods and associated reference panels with cell type–specific marker genes enable the robust estimation of the enrichment of specific cell types from bulk tissue gene expression data. We benchmarked and used enrichment estimates for seven cell types (adipocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, myocytes, neurons, and neutrophils) across 35 tissues from the GTEx project to map QTLs that are specific to at least one cell type. We mapped such cell type–interaction QTLs for expression and splicing (ieQTLs and isQTLs, respectively) by testing for interactions between genotype and cell type enrichment. RESULTS: Using 43 pairs of tissues and cell types, we found 3347 protein-coding and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes with an ieQTL and 987 genes with an isQTL (at 5% false discovery rate in each pair). To validate these findings, we tested the QTLs for replication in available external datasets and applied an independent validation using allele-specific expression from eQTL heterozygotes. We analyzed the cell type–interaction QTLs for patterns of tissue sharing and found that ieQTLs are enriched for genes with tissue-specific eQTLs and are generally not shared across unrelated tissues, suggesting that tissue-specific eQTLs originate in tissue-specific cell types. Last, we tested the ieQTLs and isQTLs for colocalization with genetic associations for 87 complex traits. We show that cell type–interaction QTLs are enriched for complex trait associations and identify colocalizations for hundreds of loci that were undetected in bulk tissue, corresponding to an increase of >50% over colocalizations with standard QTLs. Our results also reveal the cellular specificity and potential origin for a similar number of colocalized standard QTLs. CONCLUSION: The ieQTLs and isQTLs identified for seven cell types across GTEx tissues suggest that the large majority of cell type–specific QTLs remains to be discovered. Our colocalization results indicate that comprehensive mapping of cell type–specific QTLs will be highly valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex trait associations. We anticipate that the approaches presented here will complement studies mapping QTLs in single cells.

N2  - Background: Sex differences in the prevalence of cancer subtypes can inform patient screening, diagnosis, and treatment, but for many disease ontologies (DO), sex disparities have not been fully explored, especially with regards to ancestral and genomic subsets. Furthermore, existing data and reports may lack centralized expertpathology review or comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) that can enable better characterization of biologicaland environmental etiologies. Design: The cohort consisted of 276,696 de-identified patient cancers, 45.7% male and 54.3% female, submitted toFoundation Medicine for CGP. Each patient was assigned an ancestry of either African, admixed American, EastAsian, European, or South Asian, using a SNP-based machine learning methodology (J. Newberg et al., AACR2019). Within the dataset 321 DOs originate at a known tissue site of origin common to both sexes. Binomial testingfor significance of expected (50%) versus observed ratio of the sexes was performed for each DO, with correctionfor multiple hypothesis testing. For each DO, Fisher's exact tests were used to identify associations betweenancestry and sex and associations between sex and gene-level genomic biomarkers (including the detection of aviral-derived gene) with ≥ 1% prevalence with in the DO. Results: Of the 321 DOs, significant sex differences (corrected p-value ≤ 0.05) were seen in 106 DOs, of which 84were significantly skewed towards males and 22 towards females. Among all DO and ancestry combinations, 14 DO-ancestry pairings showed a statistically significant (corrected p-value ≤ 0.05) skew towards one sex when compared to all other patients in the disease group. Notably, there was an enrichment of lung small cell undifferentiated carcinoma in East Asian men (OR = 2.75, corrected p-value =0.027) and esophagus squamous cell carcinoma in East Asian men (OR = 2.55, corrected p-value = 0.028). 33 DOs exhibited sex biases in gene alterations (OR ≥ 2 and corrected p ≤ 0.05). Of particular note are a few genesthat were highly enriched in a single sex across multiple distinct disease groups: CDKN2A/CDKN2B (bladder, anus, CNS non-glioma, and kidney diseases), TERT (hepato-biliary, kidney, and anus diseases), and ASXL1 (myelomasand plasma neoplasms) for males; ATRX in both lung small cell undifferentiated carcinoma and colonadenocarcinoma for females. Conclusions: Using FMI's large cancer cohort, significant differences in the occurrences of the sexes were observed in various DOs and have the potential to inform our understanding of different disease etiologies and possible courses of therapy. Further analyses incorporating covariates may help to explain the source of theseimbalances.

N2  - Background: Machine learning (ML) have been applied to brain MRI data to derive automated diagnosis, evaluation of disease status and treatment effects. However, the accuracies and sensitivities of classification models for psychiatric disorders are usually low and not yet suitable for clinical use, likely due to inadequate sample sizes. Secondly, brains structures form a complex and interconnect network, in which different disorders often selectively affect different parts of the network. Identification and extraction of these informative structures may help to improve the ML prediction performance. Methods: We describe a deep learning method that uses an autoencoder to extract informative brain features for disease classification. As an unsupervised neural network, autoencoder does not require diagnostic labels. To improve autoencoder performance, we combined several large disease or population cohorts of data to form a mega-dataset, which includes 2271 ADHD and 1912 control subjects from the ENIGMA-ADHD cohort, 1833 ASD and 1814 Control subjects from the ENIGMA-ASD cohort, and 1629 self-reported healthy individuals from the Brain Imaging Genetics (BIG) study. Results: Increasing sample size by combining different datasets for autoencoding produced better feature reconstruction with significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) than each individual cohort (p values <.0001). The new features encoded from the combined dataset also significantly improved diagnostic prediction accuracies (areas under the ROC curve) for labeled ADHD and ASD data. Conclusions: Using cross-disorder dataset and unlabeled data in an autoencoder is an innovative way to increase sample size and improve brain feature extraction for ML models.

N2  - Psychosis is a symptomatic endpoint with many causes, complicating its pathophysiological characterization and treatment. Our study applies unsupervised clustering techniques to analyze metabolomic data, acquired using 2 different tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) methods, from an unselected group of 120 patients with psychosis. We performed an independent analysis of each of the 2 datasets generated, by both hierarchical clustering and k-means. This led to the identification of biochemically distinct groups of patients while reducing the potential biases from any single clustering method or datatype. Using our newly developed robust clustering method, which is based on patients consistently grouped together through different methods and datasets, a total of 20 clusters were ascertained and 78 patients (or 65% of the original cohort) were placed into these robust clusters. Medication exposure was not associated with cluster formation in our study. We highlighted metabolites that constitute nodes (cluster-specific metabolites) vs hubs (metabolites in a central, shared, pathway) for psychosis. For example, 4 recurring metabolites (spermine, C0, C2, and PC.aa.C38.6) were discovered to be significant in at least 8 clusters, which were identified by at least 3 different clustering approaches. Given these metabolites were affected across multiple biochemically different patient subgroups, they are expected to be important in the overall pathophysiology of psychosis. We demonstrate how knowledge about such hubs can lead to novel antipsychotic medications. Such pathways, and thus drug targets, would not have been possible to identify without patient stratification, as they are not shared by all patients, due to the heterogeneity of psychosis.

N2  - Background: PTEN loss is associated with adverse outcomes in prostate cancer and has the potential to be clinically implemented as a prognostic biomarker. Deep learning algorithms applied to digital pathology can provide automated and objective assessment of biomarkers. The objective of this work was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for automated detection and localization of PTEN loss in prostate cancer samples. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to measure PTEN protein levels on prostate tissue microarrays (TMA) from two institutions (in-house n=272 and external n=125 patients). TMA cores were visually scored for PTEN loss by pathologists and, if present, spatially annotated. In-house cohort (N=1239 cores) were divided into 70/20/10 training/validation/testing sets. Two algorithms were developed: a) Class I=core-based, to label each core for biomarker status and b) Class II=pixel-based, to spatially distinguish areas of PTEN loss within each core. ResNet1 01 architecture was used to train a multi-resolution ensemble of classifiers at 5x, 10x, and 20x for Class I task and a single classifier at simulated 40x for Class II segmentation. Results: For Class I algorithm, accuracy of PTEN status was 88.3% and 93.4% in validation and testing cohorts, respectively (Table). AI-based probability of PTEN loss was higher in cores with complete loss vs partial loss. Accuracy was improved to 90.7% in validation and 93.5% in test cohorts using the Class II region-based algorithm, with median dice scores 0.833 and 0.831, respectively. Direct application to external set demonstrated a high false positive rate. Loading trained model and conservatively re-training ("fine-tuning") on 48/320 external cohort cores improved accuracy to 93.4%. Conclusions: Results demonstrate feasibility and robustness for fully automated detection and localization of PTEN loss in prostate cancer tissue samples and possibility for time/cost-effectiveness of sample processing/scoring in research and clinical laboratories.

N2  - Background/Objective: Women with early-stage breast cancer are faced with various surgical options. Many objectives influence decisions regarding choice of surgery, and evaluating tradeoffs among multiple objectives becomes important especially when surgical treatment options may have similar oncologic outcomes, but may result in different quality of life outcomes. Although studies have reported statistically equivalent survival for breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy, small differences in survival outcomes may influence patient decision making depending on how patients value survival-related objectives relative to quality of life objectives. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the influence of oncologic outcomes on the optimal patient surgical decision; we evaluated decisions based on oncologic, quality of life, and both oncologic + quality of life outcomes. We use decision analysis to evaluate how different surgical treatments best achieve patient objectives with an explicit evaluation of tradeoffs. Methods: We used a decision analytic approach paired with simulation modeling, allowing for an evaluation of multiple patient scenarios while incorporating uncertainty. Oncologic parameters included locoregional recurrence rates (obtained from published literature) and overall survival (OS) rates. OS rates were calculated using a retrospective cohort of patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer in the National Cancer Database (2004-2016). The Kaplan- Meier estimator was used to examine OS by type of surgery (BCT, mastectomy, mastectomy + reconstruction), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status and stage (1, 2A, 2B). Quality of life objectives (e.g., satisfaction with breasts after surgery, surgical concerns, radiotherapy concerns, need for future testing/surveillance) and their utility values associated with each surgery type were obtained using expert elicitation. We accounted for variability in the optimal surgical decision due to uncertainty in oncologic and quality of life parameter values. We also incorporated variability in the surgical decision due to patient preferences for objectives. Our simulation drew values from the uncertainty bounds for outcomes of each of the oncologic and quality of life objectives. We used multi-criteria decision analysis to calculate the optimal surgical decision, using simulation to evaluate all possible scenarios representing patient rank orders for objectives. Results: Of 867,884 patients in the NCDB representing women ≤70 years old, T0-T2 (≤5cm), N0-N1, M0, with no previous diagnosis of breast cancer or any previous malignant tumors, surgery types included BCT (n = 550,638), mastectomy (n = 174,375), and mastectomy + reconstruction (n = 142,871). We simulated data for 120 scenarios (all combinations of rank order of preference for 5 objectives), generating 200 patients for each scenario (24,000 total patients). For each of the 120 scenarios, we calculated across the 200 patients the optimal surgical decision by maximizing the sum of the outcomes for each surgery type across all objectives, weighted by patient preference for objectives; the optimal decision was calculated for oncologic-only, quality of life only, and oncologic+quality of life objective scenarios. We evaluated the optimal surgical decision for 12 different combinations of ER/PR status and stage. We demonstrate that a difference as small as 5% in overall survival can switch the optimal patient decision from mastectomy to BCT for patients who value survival objectives greater than quality of life objectives. Conclusions: The addition of oncologic outcomes to quality of life-only objectives can change the optimal patient surgical decision to one that favors BCT over mastectomy. Information provided by surgeons can be an important determinant of surgical treatment decisions by patients, and therefore it is valuable for surgeons to understand how small differences in oncologic outcomes across treatments may alter optimal patient decisions for surgery type. Our decision analytic approach for evaluating the tradeoffs among oncologic and quality of life objectives on optimal surgical decisions for early-stage invasive breast cancer provides a framework that can form the basis of a shared decision making tool.

N2  - The degree of accumulated immunity in the population against past circulating viral strains to emerging strains is important for understanding transmission dynamics. Changes in viral surface proteins affect the binding of antibodies and neutralization. However, little is known about how non-surface proteins affect antigenic features. We used a dataset of 286 dengue virus (DENV) strains that circulated in Bangkok, Thailand between 1994 to 2014 to test how amino acid changes across the full DENV genome relate to antigenic characteristics, measured as log2 plaque reduction neutralization test titers for twenty global reference DENV antisera. Effect sizes of amino acid substitutions in all sixteen DENV proteins were estimated with correlated substitutions grouped as clusters to avoid collinearity. Predictions of antigenic distances between DENV pairs were made by summing effects of substitutions separating them. As expected, 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation (10% as test) suggests strong predictive power (low median root mean squared error [RMSE]) when modeled with substitutions in the E protein (0.97, range: 0.87, 1.09), with 81 substitution clusters with non-zero effect sizes. Interestingly, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), NS2A, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5) had similar predictive capacity; RMSE of 0.96 (0.86, 1.06), 0.96 (0.87, 1.08), and 0.95 (0.86, 1.07), respectively. We investigate whether signals for these non-surface proteins were confounded by the phylogeny shared with E. We re-estimated the effects using concatenated sequences of those proteins and E and observed similar RMSE. However, the number of clusters with non-zero effect sizes declined from 77 to 34 (NS1), 76 to 40 (NS2A), and 75 to 44 (NS5). For clusters with effects retained, 21, 14, and 18 observed decline in effect sizes, respectively, while 9, 19 and 19 clusters showed increases. In addition, some clusters which had zeroeffect when estimated with the single proteins had non-zero effects once adjusted for E. These mixed results hint at the possibility that non-surface proteins may contribute to antigenic differences.

N2  - Microclimates are an important component of our ecosystem and can impact human health through heat illnesses or by impacts on vector habitats. Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, is a highly localized species and its abundance is impacted by microclimate conditions. Research on microclimates can be difficult, as precise onthe-ground measurements are required; our understanding microclimate stability is limited. Although we know microclimates affect human health, there have been no attempts to predict microclimates. HOBO Temperature/Relative Humidity Data Loggers were deployed in four sites per month for 24 to 576 continuous hours (1-24 days) each month from September 2016 to August 2017 in a community in rural Ecuador. Data were summarized for each 24-hour period. We assessed the variability of summary microclimate variables across time and urban environments. We combined remotely-sensed and climate station weather data with urbanicity, elevation, and spatial components to predict summary microclimate variables across the entire community using machine learning approaches. Two-hundred and eighty-seven log-days of data were collected. We found that some microclimate variables were temporally stable, urban sites had warmer temperature variables and rural sites had higher relative humidity variables. For prediction, we found random forest algorithms were the best fit for many microclimate variables (temperature mean, median, minimum and relative humidity mean, median), with decent prediction (R2: 0.61-0.65). Generalized boosting models fit temperature and relative humidity variance well, as well as minimum and maximum relative humidity, with good prediction (R2: 0.61-0.72). The best fit model for maximum temperature was a support vector machine, though this yielded moderate prediction (R2: 0.53). Our study was limited by a small sample size over time and space, and limited availability of prediction variables at fine spatial scales. Machine learning approaches are a promising option for microclimate prediction though additional research should be conducted with validation of model predictions.

N2  - Abstract: Neuropsychiatric diseases have affected nearly one fifth of the world's population. Understanding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms is still challenging. To address this, we recently led a capstone project of PsychENCODE Phase I and built a comprehensive functional genomic resource for the human brain (Wang et al, Science, 2018). This resource includes a variety of functional genomic elements and gene regulatory linkages for healthy and psychiatric diseased brains, especially at the tissue level (e.g., DLPFC) and integrative deep learning model for better predicting diseases. Furthermore, PsychENCODE Phase II are generating emerging single cell data to understand how functional genomics across various cell types come together to drive the neuropsychiatric disorders. As the data analysis center, we will focus on the following directions in near future: (1) developing computational pipelines for harmonizing further NGS and single cell data including STARR-seq, ATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq; (2) identifying more accurate functional genomic elements (e.g.,STARR-seq enhancers) and gene regulatory linkages such as trans-eQTLs for both tissues and cell types; (3) designing advanced integrative models for predicting cell-type-specific regulatory networks, single cell deconvolution, clinical phenotypes to reveal how single cell functional genomics drive the neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, by integrating PsychENCODE I and II, we aim to build a complete genomic atlas for deciphering the functional genomics in the human brain and brain disorders. Disclosure: Nothing to disclose.

N2  - Background: A major goal in psychiatry is identifying clinically useful, non-invasive biomarkers. A flood of blood-based transcriptome-wide gene expression data has been produced in the past two decades, which could be mined with machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to identify potential disorder-specific biomarkers of psychiatric disorders that exhibit significant clinic and genetic overlap. Methods: In this study, we performed a combined-samples mega-analysis of publicly available and in-house blood-based transcriptomic data to identify dysregulated genes in schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depression (MDD) relative to unaffected comparison subjects (UCs). We performed systematic comparisons of several popular MLAs in order to identify robust transcriptome signatures that distinguish the psychiatric disorders from each other and from UCs. We used a repeated cross-validation approach to train classification models on different pseudo-random splits of the data, then evaluated accuracies of the models on unseen samples with the metric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: We achieved classification statistically significant AUCs of ∼70% for several pair-wise comparisons: UCs versus BD, UCs versus SZ, SZ versus MDD, and SZ versus BD. Classification AUCs dropped to ∼60% for MDD versus UCs, and ∼65% for MDDs versus BD, but were stronger than expected by chance. Discussion: This study sheds light on non-invasive transcriptomic features that might inform differential diagnosis of three clinically and genetically overlapping psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Purpose: To improve accuracy of brain tumor classification using MRI radiomics data. Methods: 62 MRI scans were collected under IRB exemption to include 11 embryonal tumor patients (medulloblastoma) and 51 patients with non-embryonal tumors. Tumors were segmented at 4 levels in each of T1 + Gadolinium, T2, T2 FLAIR, and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) series. All series were acquired in the axial orientation and the 4 tumor levels matched between the series. Radiomics features were calculated using 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org). Three data sets were generated from the 16 feature sets for each patient. The first data set averaged the radiomics features from the four levels in each sequence and concatenated into one feature vector per patient. In the second set, the features at each level were concatenated giving 4 feature vectors per patient. In the third data set, all permutations of feature sets were created by concatenating features from different levels across the 4 series, generating 256 feature vectors per patient. Each of the 256 vectors contains (in the same order) T1, T2, FLAIR, and ADC features. A neural network consisting of two 8-node layers separated by a dropout layer was created in Tensorflow. The network was trained and evaluated 5 times for each dataset using leave-one-out cross validation. Performance metrics were calculated for each case. Results: For the averaged feature data, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive values were 71.6%, 0.15, 0.84, 0.16, and 0.82, respectively. For the second data set, the values were 75.6%, 0.28, 0.86, 0.30, and 0.85, respectively. For the fully augmented data, the results were 75%, 0.31, 0.85, 0.31, and 0.86, respectively. Conclusion: Data augmentation is helpful in preventing overlearning in machine learning application using neural networks. The technique described here modestly improved network performance in this limited-data setting.

N2  - Background: Substantial research shows that ADHD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders and with some medical outcomes such as obesity and asthma. We also know from genome-wide association studies that common genetic variants account for some of this comorbidity. Because ADHD is typically an early-onset disorder, ADHD youth are an ideal group for applying prediction models to predict comorbidity from clinical and biological data. Methods: We will apply machine learning models to the prediction of comorbid disorders (substance abuse, depression, anxiety & obesity) in a sample of 34,009 ADHD patients from the Swedish medical registries. Predictors are social and environmental exposures (e.g., SES, pregnancy and delivery complications), the presence of other diagnoses and family history of diagnoses known to be comorbid with ADHD. Results: Applying a random forests machine learning model to the Swedish data achieved an area under the curve (AUC) statistic of 0.74 (95%CI 0.72-0.76) for the prediction of SUD in an independent validation sample. The strongest predictors of SUD in the random forests model were education scores achieved by the child, social class of the parents, crimes committed by the parents, severity of ADHD and maternal pregnancy complications. We are currently in the process of analyzing the other comorbid disorders in Sweden. Conclusions: Our results indicate that by combining clinical features, environmental exposures and family history variables, we are able to achieve a level of predictive accuracy that could be useful to identify a subset of patients for clinical monitoring or enrollment in high-risk research studies.

N2  - Purpose: Environmental change impacts the transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases. Significant associations between climate factors and vector-borne diseases have enabled predictive models to be developed that can be used in early warning systems to forecast and anticipate disease epidemics. Malaria is one such vector-borne disease, with a global distribution and significant health burden that is highly sensitive to climatic factors. Additionally, malaria is experiencing a resurgence in transmission, threatening elimination efforts. Malaria is also sensitive to non-climatic factors, such as land-use change, political instability, insecticide resistance and the effectiveness of public health control interventions. A greater understanding of the relative role of climate and non-climate factors in driving malaria transmission is needed to develop predictive models, particularly under future global change scenarios. Methods & Materials: In this study, a 20-year dataset of monthly malaria cases was used to develop a spatiotemporal Bayesian modelling framework for evaluating the relative influences of climatic and non-climatic drivers of malaria incidence in El Oro province in southern Ecuador, an area historically endemic for Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. Between the 1980s and early 2000s, El Oro experienced a surge in malaria transmission and through an effective binational collaboration became effectively malaria free in 2011. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of malaria in the region. Results: The mixed model with the best fit included the climatic variables minimum temperature and precipitation. The addition of non-climate factors, including political instability and the addition of malaria intervention activities in El Oro were also included in this model. By interacting the climate covariates with malaria intervention periods, we found the association between climate and malaria risk changed significantly following the interventions. Conclusion: Distinct variation in spatially explicit random effects was found, which suggest that other environmental factors, such as land use change or area-specific intervention efforts should be explored to understand this variation. This study demonstrates that both environmental, socio-economic and political factors should be considered when developing predictive disease models, to understand the potential environmental suitability for re-emergence in the region, given a lapse in control efforts or periods of civil unrest.

N2  - Background: Transcriptome-wide screens of peripheral blood during the onset and development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicate widespread immune dysregulation. However, little is known as to whether biological sex and the type of traumatic event influence shared or distinct biological pathways in PTSD. Methods: We performed a combined analysis of five independent PTSD blood transcriptome studies covering seven types of trauma in 229 PTSD and 311 comparison individuals to synthesize the extant data. Results: Analyses by trauma type revealed a clear pattern of PTSD gene expression signatures distinguishing interpersonal (IP)-related traumas from combat-related traumas. Co-expression network analyses integrated all data and identified distinct gene expression perturbations across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD, including one wound-healing module downregulated in men exposed to combat traumas, one IL-12-mediated signaling module upregulated in men exposed to IP-related traumas, and two modules associated with lipid metabolism and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity upregulated in women exposed to IP-related traumas. Remarkably, a high degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation across sex and modes of trauma in PTSD was also observed converging on common signaling cascades, including cytokine, innate immune, and type I interferon pathways. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings provide a broad view of immune dysregulation in PTSD and demonstrate inflammatory pathways of molecular convergence and specificity. We further discuss methods for adjusting for batch effects and cell types as well as the utility of machine learning algorithms which may inform mechanisms and diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder.

N2  - Background: Polygenic risk scoring (“the Purcell method”) has become a widely used technique for summarizing small risk-associated effects across thousands of genetic variants to predict liability for complex disorders. An analogous method has not yet been introduced for application in transcriptomic data. Here, we present a novel method called polytranscript risk scoring (PTRS) which measures transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression associated with a disorder or phenotype. Methods: PTRS is a single variable that can be easily computed and incorporated into standard machine learning models for objectives such as risk prediction. In this study, we constructed PTRS for bipolar disorder (BD) using our multi-site transcriptomic mega-analysis that compared peripheral blood gene expression profiles in a predominantly adult sample of cases affected with BD (n = 95) with non-affected comparison subjects (NCs, n = 111). Results: PTRSs explained a significant proportion of risk for BD and could accurately discriminate BD-affected cases from NCs with an average AUC of about 70% (p < 0.0001). We hypothesized that PTRS for BD may generalize to other forms of the illness, thus we tested the association of PTRS with dimensional measures of behavioral functioning that are intimately related to pediatric BD (i.e., aggression, anxiety with depression, and attention problems). Regression analysis revealed that PTRS for BD was significantly predictive of aggression in a sample of school-aged children (n = 92). Discussion: Our study demonstrates the potential utility of PTRS for risk prediction, thereby enabling further molecular characterization of complex disorders and phenotypes.

N2  - Background: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a complex and highly heritable psychiatric disorder with a world-wide prevalence near 1%. There is converging evidence from genetic, molecular, and clinical studies of BD that implicate numerous neurotransmitter and immune signaling abnormalities. These abnormalities have been described previously in Schizophrenia (SZ), which has close genetic and molecular ties to BD. Methods: The purpose of this investigation was to uncover generalizable biomarkers for BD using a cross-study analysis of six microarray data sets comprising peripheral blood transcriptomes for patients with a DSM-diagnosis of BD (n=77) and unaffected comparison subjects (n=81); furthermore, we sought to compare transcriptomic signatures between BD and SZ (obtained from a prior study). We performed a combined-subject differential expression mega-analysis with regression models applied per gene, each adjusted for clinical factors and study heterogeneity. In addition, we surveyed gene sets and gene networks for consistent differential expression in BD. Results: Three genes were associated with BD at a level of significance that withstood rigorous statistical correction for multiple testing. In addition, differential expression of gene sets in BD was found; functions of these gene sets included innate immunity, energy production in mitochondrial complexes, and metabolism of RNA and proteins, among other biological pathways previously related to BD or psychosis. Lastly, we deployed a machine-learning pipeline, which discriminated BD patients from unaffected comparison subjects and SZ patients with high accuracy based on 77 genes (mean AUCROC=0.849, 95% CI=0.837 – 0.859). Discussion: Our study provides strong evidence in support of candidate biomarkers for BD and introduces potentially generalizable blood-based classifiers for BD. Our findings have relevance for cross-disorder genomic analyses. This work warrants expansion to identifying gene signatures that discriminate other adult and childhood neuropsychiatric disorders.

N2  - Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 45 children aged 3–17 and is characterized by a wide array of deficits in social interaction, communication, and behavior. Despite significant evidence for genetic contributions to ASD risk, single gene variants as a group do not explain the vast majority of cases. Consequently, considerable interest has turned to the study of epigenetic mechanisms as potential contributing factors. miRNAs are now well-recognized epigenetic regulators of gene expression that influence biological processes in all cell types and are released from the cells in which they are synthesized and circulate throughout the body in extracellular fluids. We previously identified significant alterations in miRNA levels in the saliva of ASD subjects (average age 9) compared with matched typically developing control children. We also observed (but did not report) that the salivary microbiome of ASD children was significantly different than that of the control children. In the present study, we sought to replicate and extend these observations on the oral microtranscriptome and microbiome of ASD children in a larger and younger cohort. Methods: Parental consent was obtained for all subjects. More than 350 samples were collected from children aged 2–6, with either a confirmed diagnosis of ASD, Developmental Delay, or healthy controls. Comprehensive medical and demographic information was obtained using detailed questionnaires, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (2nd Edition), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (2nd Edition). Identification and quantification of saliva miRNA and microbiome abundance were performed using NGS on a NextSeq. 500 instrument at the SUNY Molecular Analysis Core (SUNYMAC) at Upstate Medical University. Alignment of NGS reads was performed to the miRbase21 database using the Shrimp2 algorithm in Partek Flow software to identify mature and precursor miRNAs and alignment of metatranscriptome reads was performed to the Human Microbiome Database, using K-SLAM and Kraken software. Data were subjected to quantile normalization, filtered for quality control, and examined for their diagnostic utility using machine learning algorithms. The most promising variables were also examined to identify salient patterns and subjected to functional analysis. Results: Saliva miRNA and microbiome taxon variables demonstrated the ability to distinguish children with ASD from typically developing controls, with accuracy approximating 75–80% based on Monte-Carlo Cross Validation. When combined, the best miRNA and taxon classifiers from the learning algorithm performed at an overall accuracy level exceeding 86%, including more than 90% accuracy for ASD children. Notably, the top miRNA classifiers disproportionately targeted mRNAs that were enriched in several key biological pathways of interest for ASD, including Amphetamine Addiction, Axon Guidance, and Oxytocin Signaling. Notably, many miRNAs and taxon classifiers exhibited robust correlations, suggesting possible host-microbiome signaling. Discussion: This is the first report of correlated miRNA and microbiome elements in saliva. Our results indicate a high degree of potential diagnostic utility in using these saliva-based data for ASD and Developmental Delay. Ongoing work is establishing the quantitative relationship between these variables and functional measures of ASD symptoms and severity, as well as co-morbid medical conditions including sleep disorders and GI disturbances.

N2  - Background: The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relies on behavioral assessment. Efforts to define biomarkers of ASD have not resulted in an objective, reliable test. Studies of RNA levels in ASD have demonstrated potential utility, but have been limited by a focus on single RNA types, small sample sizes, and lack of developmental delay controls. We hypothesized that a saliva-based poly-“omic” RNA panel could objectively distinguish children with ASD from their neurotypical peers and children with non-ASD developmental delay. Methods: This multi-center cross-sectional study included 456 children, ages 19–83 months. Children were either neurotypical (n = 134) or had a diagnosis of ASD (n = 238), or non-ASD developmental delay (n = 84). Comprehensive human and microbial RNA abundance was measured in the saliva of all participants using unbiased next generation sequencing. Prior to analysis, the sample was randomly divided into a training set (82% of subjects) and an independent validation test set (18% of subjects). The training set was used to develop an RNA-based algorithm that distinguished ASD and non-ASD children. The validation set was not used in model development (feature selection or training) but served only to validate empirical accuracy. Results: In the training set (n = 372; mean age 51 months; 75% male; 51% ASD), a set of 32 RNA features (controlled for demographic and medical characteristics), identified ASD status with a cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86–0.88). In the completely separate validation test set (n = 84; mean age 50 months; 85% male; 60% ASD), the algorithm maintained an AUC of 0.88 (82% sensitivity and 88% specificity). Notably, the RNA features were implicated in physiologic processes related to ASD (axon guidance, neurotrophic signaling). Conclusion: Salivary poly-omic RNA measurement represents a novel, non-invasive approach that can accurately identify children with ASD. This technology could improve the specificity of referrals for ASD evaluation or provide objective support for ASD diagnoses.

N2  - Diagnosis of heart disease requires that a medical practitioner investigate heart auscultations for irregular sounds, followed by echocardiography and electrocardiography tests. These expensive tests also require specialized technicians to operate. We present a low-cost, patient-centered device for the initial screening of the heart sounds that can be potentially used by the users on themselves. They can later share these readings with their healthcare providers. We have created an innovative mobile-health service platform for analyzing and classifying heart sounds. The presented system enables remote patient-monitoring by integrating advanced wireless communications with a customized low-cost stethoscope. This system also permits remote management of a patient's cardiac status while maximizing patient mobility. The smartphone application facilitates recording, processing, visualizing, listening to, and classification of heart sounds. We build our classification model using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and Hidden Markov Model. This application is tested in a hospital environment to collect live recordings from patients with positive results. The smartphone application correctly detected 92.68% of abnormal heart conditions in clinical trials at UT Southwestern Hospital.

N2  - Background: Identifying genetic variants contributing to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is complicated by the involvement of numerous common genetic variants with small effects, interacting with each other as well as with environmental factors, such as stress exposure. Random forest regression is well-suited to explore this complexity, as it allows for the analysis of many predictors simultaneously, taking into account any higher-order interactions among them. Methods: Using random forest regression, we predicted ADHD severity, measured by Conners' Parent Rating Scales, from 686 adolescents and young adults (including 281 diagnosed with ADHD). The analysis included 17,374 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 29 genes previously linked to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, together with information on exposure to 24 individual long-term difficulties or stressful life events. Results: The model explained 12.5% of variance in ADHD severity. The most important SNP for prediction, which also showed the strongest interaction with stress exposure, was located in a region regulating the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Other high-ranking SNPs were found in or near NPSR1, ESR1, GABRA6, PER3, NR3C2, and DRD4. Chronic stressors were more influential than single, severe, life events. Conclusions: Random forest regression may be used to investigate how multiple genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to ADHD. It is able to implicate novel SNPs of interest, interacting with stress exposure, and may explain inconsistent findings in ADHD genetics. This exploratory approach may be best combined with more hypothesis-driven research; top predictors, and their interactions with one another, should be replicated in independent samples.

N2  - Machine learning plays a major role in many scientific investigations. However, non-expert programmers may struggle to implement the elaborate pipelines necessary to build highly accurate and generalizable models. We introduce exprso, a new R package that is an intuitive machine learning suite designed specifically for non-expert programmers. Built initially for the classification of high-dimensional data, exprso uses an object-oriented framework to encapsulate a number of common analytical methods into a series of interchangeable modules. This includes modules for feature selection, classification, high-throughput parameter grid-searching, elaborate cross-validation schemes (e.g., Monte Carlo and nested cross-validation), ensemble classification, and prediction. In addition, exprso also supports multi-class classification (through the 1-vs-all generalization of binary classifiers) and the prediction of continuous outcomes.

N2  - Background: The application of microarray technology in studying neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders was heralded as paradigm-shifting, as it allowed for unbiased assessment of cell and tissue function. This technology was widely adopted, initially in studies of postmortem brain tissue, and later in studies of peripheral blood, which is more easily accessible in living subjects and could provide signals for clinically useful biomarkers. To date, several blood-based microarray studies have been published describing transcriptomic differences between children with ASD and their typically developing counterparts, yet individual studies were often underpowered to detect significant differences after rigorous statistical correction, limiting the ability to make confident conclusions. Methods: We sought to aggregate individual subject-level data from all available studies in order to perform a powerful combined samples mega-analysis using mixedeffect linear modeling to obtain best-estimates of differentially expressed genes in ASD blood samples. Array data from a total of eight studies underwent uniform pre-processing and normalization, yielding a total of 1,133 subjects, corresponding to 654 ASD cases and 479 typically developing, unrelated comparison subjects. Study site was modeled as a random effect and diagnosis, age, sex, and self-reported ethnicity were modeled as fixed effects; linear models were adjusted per gene to remove non-significant covariates (p 4 0.1), in order to provide best-estimates of transcripts dysregulated in'ASD. Results: We identified differentially expressed genes and elucidated their emergent functions using a gene-set analysis approach. We also examined co-expression networks and the potential enrichment of dysregulated genes with genetic variants previously shown to regulate expression (i.e. expression quantitative trait loci) and variants associated with ASD (i.e. Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Genome-Wide Associated SNPs). We constructed generalizable, transcriptomic machine-learning classifiers within separate training and validation datasets. These results will be presented in detail. Discussion: We discuss the limitations of our approach and the implications of the findings.

N2  - Background: The application of microarray technology in schizophrenia research was heralded as paradigm-shifting, as it allowed for unbiased assessment of cell and tissue function. This technology was widely adopted, initially in studies of postmortem brain tissue, and later in studies of peripheral blood. The collective body of schizophrenia microarray literature suffers from inconsistencies between studies and failure to replicate top hits, in part due to small sample sizes, cohort-specific effects, differences in array types, and other confounders. The major unanswered question after 15 years of microarray studies of schizophrenia is: "What have we truly learned?" Methods: We performed two mega-analyses of all available microarray data from postmortem prefrontal cortices (n = 315) and from ex-vivo blood tissues (n = 552) sampled from schizophrenia cases and non-psychotic comparison subjects. Potential sources of confounding, such as complete blood counts, though absent from these meta-data, were explored by estimating immune cell type proportions from gene expression signatures. Regression models were adjusted per gene to remove non-significant covariates (p > 0.1), providing best-estimates of transcripts dysregulated in schizophrenia. We evaluated biological pathways, coexpression networks, and genetic factors associated with the differentially expressed genes. We constructed a generalizable machine-learning classifier using the blood-based microarray data from independent training and validation sets. A power analysis is provided to serve as a reference point for future investigations. Results: The identities of the most significantly dysregulated genes and their emergent biological functions were largely distinct for each tissue, but the findings were consistent with shared regulatory factors (e.g., coordinate activation or inhibition of transcription factors and miRNA species across tissues). Our network-based analyses converged upon similar patterns of heightened innate immune gene expression in both brain and blood in schizophrenia. Discussion: This study analyzed the largest available pool of microarray data from postmortem brain and ex'vivo peripheral blood to identify the gene expression signature of schizophrenia. Our preliminary analyses are supportive of the hypothesis of an abnormally activate immune system in schizophrenia. We also present supporting evidence of the potential role of genetic factors in gene dysregulation associated with schizophrenia, such as expression quantitative trait loci and schizophrenia-associated GWAS hits overlaying coding segments and regulatory DNA among the top dysregulated genes observed in our study. Although constrained by numerous factors, our study provides a reliable atlas of the average gene expression signature of schizophrenia in a critical brain region (prefrontal cortex) and in peripheral blood samples.

N2  - Introduction: Adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in patient health care. “Noshow” appointments lead to disruption in providing timely care and contribute to suboptimal resource use. We decided to look into the no-show rate of our practice. Methods: University GI Clinic has a standard practice of mailing letters to all new consults. The front desk staff calls all the patients with new and follow-up appointments 1-3 days ahead. A telephone call was also made to the no-shows to enquire about the reason. We collected the list of no-show patients every day for a period of 30 working days. We also analyzed the demographics, type of insurance, employment status, time of appointment etc of the patients who no-showed. Results: A total of 1159 appointments were made and 283 (24.4%) no-showed. Wednesdays had the highest no-show rate (29%) with Fridays having the least (19%). The highest no-show rate was on a pre-long weekend Wednesday (43%). Faculty had a 22% no-show rate compared to 34% for the fellows. 95% of the no-shows received the reminder telephone call. We were able to contact 40% of the patients who no-showed. 20% of the no-shows had reasons like family emergency, could not get out of work, had another appointment etc. 73% of the no-shows were un-employed/disabled. 34% of the no-shows and 66% of the patients who showed up to their appointments confirmed their appointments (p < 0.05). Conclusion: No-shows can cause revenue losses that range from a few hundred thousand to few million dollars. They increase Emergency Room visits, hospitalizations and impair patient care. Reminding the patients about their appointments have previously shown to decrease the no show rates. Factors that could predict no-shows include the patient's previous appointment-keeping pattern, length of time from scheduling to appointment date etc. Some practices developed no-show predictive models and employed dynamic overbooking strategies, thereby decreasing waste of time and resources in the clinic. Other strategies include appointment reminder cards and giving the patients ownership of their appointments through patient access portal etc. Sometimes, in spite of the best efforts from the clinic, other factors like disconnected phone, wrong number, wrong address, failure to check messages and economic status could be affecting no-show rates. Our study shows the multi-factorial causality of the no-shows in the clinic and the need for developing newer strategies to improve them. (Figure presented).

N2  - An elderly man with hypertension presented after falling. CT head showed an acute stroke of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. He was outside the window for thrombolysis therefore was managed medically. The injury resulted in dysphagia and given the neurologic etiology, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was warranted (1). The patient lacked capacity; therefore his healthcare proxy decided to pursue PEG placement. Since 1992 there has been a ten-fold increase in PEG placement and three-fold increase in mortality 30-days post procedure (1). Likewise the percent of PEGs placed for non-evidence based indications nearly doubled (1) suggesting a lowered threshold for PEG placement in today's 'more is better' culture. Data shows 28% of patients with dysphagia post-stroke die during index hospitalization, the most common reason being aspiration pneumonia (2). While risk factors for aspiration may determine if PEG is appropriate, a predictive model for survival does not exist. This requires consideration of patient wishes with potential outcomes (i.e., prolonged death) explained to family. One of the most heart-wrenching decisions a family may have to make is when to pursue artificial nutrition for a patient without capacity. Most families are comfortable deciding to forego resuscitation, but when it comes to artificial nutrition, many feel they cannot let their relative 'starve to death' (3). Unlike code status, only 3% of healthcare proxies deciding to pursue tube feeds had previously discussed with their loved one (3). Despite adequate nutrition, sixteen days after PEG our patient expired. In hindsight, the PEG should not have been offered as this likely prolonged death. Yet pressured by a culture of medical excess, it was offered. PEG placement is an ethically complex topic; but individualized care can be achieved with nasogastric tube feeds. This less invasive option can be administered safely for 6-8 weeks (4); allowing for prognostic indicators to become evident and giving families' peace in knowing their loved one is nourished. Our case exemplifies the difficulty in predicting mortality in patients who undergo PEG after a stroke. When the prognosis is uncertain, nasogastric tube feeds should be trialed first and if the patient survives more than a few weeks, then evaluation of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is reasonable. With this standard of care, the number of unnecessary PEGs will likely decrease.

N2  - Purpose: To reduce differences in features calculated from MRI brain scans acquired at different field strengths with or without Gadolinium contrast. Methods: Brain scans were processed for 111 epilepsy patients to extract hippocampus and thalamus features. Scans were acquired on 1.5 T scanners with Gadolinium contrast (group A), 1.5T scanners without Gd (group B), and 3.0 T scanners without Gd (group C). A total of 72 features were extracted. Features were extracted from original scans and from scans where the image pixel values were rescaled to the mean of the hippocampi and thalami values. For each data set, cluster analysis was performed on the raw feature set and for feature sets with normalization (conversion to Z scores). Two methods of normalization were used: The first was over all values of a given feature, and the second by normalizing within the patient group membership. The clustering software was configured to produce 3 clusters. Group fractions in each cluster were calculated. Results: For features calculated from both the non-rescaled and rescaled data, cluster membership was identical for both the non-normalized and normalized data sets. Cluster 1 was comprised entirely of Group A data, Cluster 2 contained data from all three groups, and Cluster 3 contained data from only groups 1 and 2. For the categorically normalized data sets there was a more uniform distribution of group data in the three Clusters. A less pronounced effect was seen in the rescaled image data features. Conclusion: Image Rescaling and feature renormalization can have a significant effect on the results of clustering analysis. These effects are also likely to influence the results of supervised machine learning algorithms. It may be possible to partly remove the influence of scanner field strength and the presence of Gadolinium based contrast in feature extraction for radiomics applications.

N2  - Background: Our study aims to evaluate the relationship between social support (SS) and chemotherapy-related toxicities (CRT) among older cancer patients. We hypothesized that patients with poor social support (PSS) would be at increased risk of CRT. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis on a previously reported study (Hurria et al, JCO 2011) that prospectively followed older (age 65+) cancer patients to assess the development of CRT, and its relationship with geriatric assessment items. A predictive model for CRT was developed (Cancer and Aging Research Group [CARG] CRT risk score). In this analysis, we assessed the relationship between patients' SS (measured by Medical-Outcome Study- Social Support Survey-12 item), each item in social support survey, and the development of grade III or more hematological (H) and non-hematological toxicities (NH). Patients were categorized to PSS with total SS score of •>'•• 75 and good social support (GSS) with a score of 76-100. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association univariately as well as after adjusting for CRT risk score. Results: 498 older cancer patients were included for this study. Among these patients, 26% (n = 130) had PSS. After adjusting for the CARG CRT risk score, patients with PSS, had less documented grade CRT compared to patients with GSS (OR = 0.58, P = 0.02). Assessing each individual SS item showed one item mostly accounted for this observation: whether the patient has someone to take them to the doctor. Patients who don't have somebody to take them to doctors “most” or “all of the time”, were less likely to have grade 3+ CRT (OR = 0.43, p = 0.008) compared to patients who had someone to take them to doctors most or all of the time. This association strengthened after adjusting for CARG model (OR = 0.28, p = 0.001). The associations are similar for H (OR = 0.22, p = 0.005) and NH toxicities (OR = 0.33, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, older cancer patients with PSS were less likely to develop CRT. However, less availability of having someone to take them to the doctor accounted for most of this finding. The possibility of significant underreporting by these patients needs to be explored in future studies.

N2  - Background: Over the past decade, we have pursued blood-based biomarkers of mental disorders including schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have focused on transcriptomic biomarkers, as gene expression is dynamic, is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and has both state and trait qualities. Methods: Our first transcriptomic study of SZ and BD identified numerous genes that were differentially expressed in blood samples from patients compared to non-psychotic comparison subjects, but we soon realized that lists of differentially expressed genes are not actionable. We then deployed support vector machine (SVM) models to build and validate classifier algorithms that could “diagnose” patients with SZ or BD. We subsequently applied these methods to diagnosing ASDs in children and to predicting PTSD among U.S. Marines exposed to combat trauma. With each iteration, we delved deeper into the SVM parameters that could be optimized to increase the accuracy of our classifiers. Results: Most recently, we have been working in our large samples to identify the parameters of SVMs that most strongly influence the generalizability of the derived classifiers, and which parameters allow the most robust models. We have also been employing ensemble SVMs and comparing their results to other machine-learning algorithms, such as random forests. Conclusions: Here we will review the results of our transcriptomic biomarker studies in a historical context, and at each stage shed light on an important parameter or modeling decision and how it can impact the results of such pursuits in the future.

N2  - In human cells, the basal body (BB) core comprises a ninefold microtubule-triplet cylindrical structure. Distal and subdistal appendages are located at the distal end of BB, where they play indispensable roles in cilium formation and function. Most cells that arrest in the G0 stage of the cell cycle initiate BB docking at the plasma membrane followed by BB-mediated growth of a solitary primary cilium, a structure required for sensing the extracellular environment and cell signaling. In addition to the primary cilium, motile cilia are present in specialized cells, such as sperm and airway epithelium. Mutations that affect BB function result in cilia dysfunction. This can generate syndromic disorders, collectively called ciliopathies, for which there are no effective treatments. In this review, we focus on the features and functions of BBs and centrosomes in Homo sapiens.

N2  - The clinical presentation, course and treatment of methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP) are similar to that observed in schizophrenia (SCZ) and subsequently, MAP has been hypothesized as a pharmacological and environmental model of SCZ [1]. However, several challenges currently exist in accurately diagnosing MAP at the molecular and cognitive level before the MAP model can contribute to the discovery of SCZ biomarkers. We identified blood-based gene networks and biomarkers of MAP, and further determined how these changes were associated with brain structural volumes and clinical features of MAP. We directly assessed subcortical brain structural volumes and clinical parameters of MAP within the framework of a genome-wide RNA-Seq blood transcriptome analysis of subjects diagnosed with MAP (N = 10), METH-dependent subjects without psychotic symptoms (MA) (N = 10) and healthy controls (N = 10). Each subject underwent clinical assessment using the Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [2] and completed a battery of self-report questionnaires. Subcortical brain structure volumes were acquired on a 3T Magnetom Allegra magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and scanned using the FreeSurfer software package. Genome-wide blood transcriptome measurements were subjected to unsupervised weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) [3] to identify discrete groups of functionally-related coexpressed genes (modules) then associated with clinical features and brain structural volumes using Pearson correlation and a Student's asymptotic p-value for significance. Subsequently, a DLDA multi-class machinelearning algorithm, based on differentially expressed genes, predicted individual blood-based biomarkers of MAP. To prioritize candidate gene-modules and genes as containing shared genomic evidence with psychotic disorders and SCZ (in absence of METH), we used an extensive data-mining technique, termed convergent functional genomics (CFG). We discovered one down-regulated MAP specific module implicated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis dysfunction, with 61 genes previously found implicated in psychosis and SCZ across independent blood and postmortem brain studies using CFG evidence. Phenotypic characterization of this module demonstrated association with differences in brain structure volumes including the anterior corpus callosum (CC) (r = -0.55, p = 0.002) and the nucleus accumbens (r = -0.40, p = 0.03). Further, an up-regulated psychoticism and CC specific module implicating circadian clock dysfunction contained 38 CFG validated genes. Subsequently, our machine-learning approach identified single blood-based biomarkers able to differentiate controls from methamphetamine dependents with 86% accuracy and MAP from MA subjects with 90% accuracy. CFG evidence validated a significant proportion of these MAP biomarkers onto independent studies including CLN3, FBP1, TBC1D2 and ZNF821 (RNA degradation), ELK3 and SINA3 (circadian clock) and PIGF and UHMK1 (ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis). Importantly, structural MRI data revealed significantly lower bilateral hippocampal volumes in MAP subjects (p = 0.01), a finding entirely consistent with previous reports of pathological hippocampus changes in MAP and first-episode schizophrenia. We validated 99 functionally-related candidate MAP genes as having shared genomic evidence with independent psychosis and SCZ studies and determined there relationship to subcortical brain volume and clinical differences. These high overlaps suggest similar biological mechanisms specific to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, circadian clock and RNA degradation underlying the pathophysiology of psychosis, regardless of substance abuse. Collectively, these results support the MAP model as a translational paradigm for SCZ research.

N2  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the utility of novel verbal fluency scores for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method: Verbal fluency lists (animals, vegetables, F, A, and S) from 107 MCI patients and 51 cognitively normal controls were transcribed into electronic text files and automatically scored with traditional raw scores and five types of novel scores computed using methods from machine learning and natural language processing. Additional scores were derived from structural MRI scans: region of interest measures of hippocampal and ventricular volumes and gray matter scores derived from performing ICA on measures of cortical thickness. Over 4 years of follow-up, 24 MCI patients converted to AD. Using conversion as the outcome variable, ensemble classifiers were constructed by training classifiers on the individual groups of scores and then entering predictions from the primary classifiers into regularized logistic regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was measured for classifiers trained with five groups of available variables. Results: Classifiers trained with novel scores outperformed those trained with raw scores (AUC 0.872 vs 0.735; P < .05 by DeLong test). Addition of structural brain measurements did not improve performance based on novel scores alone. Conclusion: The brevity and cost profile of verbal fluency tasks recommends their use for clinical decision making. The word lists generated are a rich source of information for predicting outcomes in MCI. Further work is needed to assess the utility of verbal fluency for early AD.

N2  - RATIONALE. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause characterized by the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Our goal is to develop a molecular test that can help diagnose patients with IPF on samples collected by transbronchial biopsy (TBB) thus eliminating the need for surgical biopsy. To circumvent difficulties in making a pathology diagnosis directly from TBBs, we hypothesize that a genomic signature can be identified that will provide diagnostic information on TBBs without the need for surgery. Such a pre-operative diagnosis of UIP should provide useful information to aid clinicians in diagnosis of IPF and distinguish it from other interstitial lung diseases (ILD). We present preliminary results of an algorithm trained by pathology “truth” to distinguish UIP versus non-UIP in TBB samples. METHODS. We developed classifiers of UIP vs. non-UIP using 93 TBB samples from 27 patients. Using genome-wide whole-transcriptome data measuring all human genes, we developed classifiers to differentiate UIP (n=54) from other non-UIP samples (n=39) including non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), unclassifiable fibrotic ILD, emphysema, organizing pneumonia (OP), respiratory bronchiolitis (RB) and sarcoidosis (SARC). Using leave-one-patient-out (LOPO) cross-validation, the performance of several classifiers were evaluated, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, penalized logistic regression, and an ensemble of the three. We further investigated a particularly challenging subtype; unclassifiable fibrotic ILD. Additional classifiers were trained that excluded unclassifiable fibrotic ILD samples, and they were set aside and evaluated as a test set for their performance separating UIP from non-UIP. RESULTS. Multiple classifiers were built using increasing numbers of genes. Maximum classification performance of UIP vs. non-UIP was observed with n=40 genes using a penalized logistic regression classifier. LOPO cross-validation showed that the trained classifier could distinguish UIP from non-UIP with a maximal area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.85 (specificity =0.92 and sensitivity=0.61). The classifiers trained while excluding unclassifiable fibrotic ILD samples achieved an AUC in LOPO cross-validation very similar to the AUC in the held-out test set, indicating our ability to capture UIP in this difficult subgroup. CONCLUSIONS. The performance of TBB classifiers shows potential to diagnose UIP based on transcriptional markers. Future analyses will be aimed toward further improving classifiers based on increased sample size and incorporating additional information into the algorithm, such as radiologic and clinical features.

N2  - The drug-loading properties of nanocarriers depend on the chemical structures and properties of their building blocks. Here we customize telodendrimers (linear dendritic copolymer) to design a nanocarrier with improved in vivo drug delivery characteristics. We do a virtual screen of a library of small molecules to identify the optimal building blocks for precise telodendrimer synthesis using peptide chemistry. With rationally designed telodendrimer architectures, we then optimize the drug-binding affinity of a nanocarrier by introducing an optimal drug-binding molecule (DBM) without sacrificing the stability of the nanocarrier. To validate the computational predictions, we synthesize a series of nanocarriers and evaluate systematically for doxorubicin delivery. Rhein-containing nanocarriers have sustained drug release, prolonged circulation, increased tolerated dose, reduced toxicity, effective tumour targeting and superior anticancer effects owing to favourable doxorubicin-binding affinity and improved nanoparticle stability. This study demonstrates the feasibility and versatility of the de novo design of telodendrimer nanocarriers for specific drug molecules, which is a promising approach to transform nanocarrier development for drug delivery.

N2  - Microorganisms in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are essential to environmental sustainability. In the marine environment, invertebrates often depend on metabolic cooperation with their endosymbionts. Coral reefs, one of the most important marine ecosystems, are based on the symbiosis between a broad diversity of dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium and a wide phyletic diversity of hosts (i.e., cnidarian, molluscan, poriferan). This diversity is reflected in the ecology and physiology of the symbionts, yet the underlying biochemical mechanisms are still poorly understood. We examined metabolite profiles of four cultured species of Symbiodinium known to form viable symbioses with reef-building corals, S. microadriaticum (cp-type A194), S. minutum (cp-type B184), S. psygmophilum (cp-type B224) and S. trenchii (cp-type D206). Metabolite profiles were shown to differ among Symbiodinium species and were found to be affected by their physiological response to growth in different temperatures and light regimes. A combined Random Forests and Bayesian analysis revealed that the four Symbiodinium species examined primarily differed in their production of sterols and sugars, including a C29 stanol and the two sterols C28Δ5 and C28Δ5,22, as well as differences in metabolite abundances of a hexose and inositol. Inositol levels were also strongly affected by changes in temperature.

N2  - Ecuador is facing new challenges related to climate change impacts in the human health sector, especially for emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue fever. Although the public health sector is investing substantially in measures of surveillance and mosquito control, the effects of climate variability and change are not considered in the current strategies for reducing dengue virus transmission. Effective planning for adaptation measures in the public health sector would require the following: a) a better understanding of climate and environmental interactions with the vector and disease transmission in which a monitoring and surveillance climate-disease program is fundamental b) an evaluation of the effectiveness of current policies and measures in reducing the vector disease including 'what if' analysis in projected scenarios, and finally c) building scientific capacity in research institutions and looking for a permanent dialog with stakeholders and decision makers to discuss the adaptation measures on the climate change impacts on infectious diseases. With this perspective, a consortium of national and international institutions and local public health organizations is developing an interdisciplinary research program on dengue transmission in the city of Machala, Ecuador. This 3-year study will develop predictive models by linking climate factors with local neighborhood social and environmental conditions to predict when and where dengue outbreaks will occur in Machala, Ecuador. This study aims to link multi-scale climate phenomena to neighborhood-level dengue risk, fundamentally changing how we think about climate-disease dynamics. At the same time, an iterative process of monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures linked to decision making aids and tools is proposed for developing climate change policy in the public health sector.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Urine leak after partial nephrectomy is a complication more frequently encountered with increasing tumor complexity. We developed a nomogram to predict postoperative urine leaks after complex partial nephrectomy and validated it with an independent set of patients. Materials and Methods: A cohort of 130 multifocal complex partial nephrectomies performed between January 2008 and September 2012 was divided into a training (50 most recent patients) and validation set (80 prior patients). Urine leak was defined as elevation of JP drain creatinine significantly above serum after post op day 2. For the predictive model used in the nomogram, parameters that were significantly associated on logistic regression with postop urine leak (p<0.05) or with a trend towards significance (p<0.1) were included. Results: The mean age of the training cohort was 49.5 years old with a mean of one prior surgery and 13.1 tumors removed per kidney per operation. The validation cohort had a mean age of 48.6 years, 0.9 previous surgeries, and 6.7 tumors removed per operation. Postoperative urine leak was seen in 28 patients. A nomogram with good predictive characteristics (c-index=0.85) was generated from the training set based on blood loss, number of tumors resected, and number of prior kidney procedures (Figure 1). An optimal probability cutoff for assignment of patients into the “likely to leak” category was determined to be 25% on the nomogram based on the training cohort. The nomogram correctly predicted postop urine leak 88% of cases in the training cohort. This nomogram was then applied on the 80 patient validation cohort and correctly predicted leak in 74% of cases. Conclusions: Risk of urine leak increases with increased blood loss, number of resected tumors and number of prior renal surgeries. A validated nomogram strongly predicts post-operative urine leak for complex partial nephrectomy with good accuracy in both the training and validation cohorts.

N2  - RATIONALE. Diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILD) requires multidisciplinary evaluation of clinical, radiographic and often histopathologic data from surgical lung biopsy (SLB). Our goal is to develop a molecular test that differentiates ILDs from biopsies collected using less invasive procedures. We present preliminary results using genomic signatures to classify common ILD sub-types using two methods for assigning “truth” labels. METHODS. We collected >300 surgical tissues with IRB approval from ILD Centers and tissue procurement services in the U.S. and Mexico. Diagnostic labels were derived from local histopathology, central pathology, or local multidisciplinary team (MDT) from study sites. Using dense whole-transcriptional data from arrays and next-generation sequencing, and multi-dimensional machine learning algorithms, we developed molecular classifiers to differentiate ILD patterns including UIP, non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). We selected a subgroup of cases where the only label used was pathology diagnoses achieved by 2/2, 2/3 or 3/3 consensus of expert central review. We also selected cases where pathology diagnoses were consistent with clinical diagnoses. We measured RNA transcription of >22,000 human genes using microarrays. A subset (n=95) were also analyzed by RNA Sequencing at a depth of 80 million reads. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were built using increasing numbers of genes and performance assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS. Performance of the classifiers was visualized by Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. Classifiers trained on microarray data using pathology-only labels distinguished UIP (n=46) from NSIP (n=26) and UIP from HP (n=16) with areas under the ROC curve (AUC) each= 0.98. UIP was distinguished from other forms of ILD (HP, NSIP and others e.g. sarcoidosis, n=46) with an AUC of 0.96. Classifiers using a combination of clinical diagnoses congruent with pathology distinguished IPF (n=49) from normal (n=38), IPF from NSIP (n=21) and IPF from HP (n=21) with AUCs of 0.99, 0.93, 0.94, respectively. IPF was distinguished from other forms of ILD (HP, idiopathic NSIP and others) with an AUC of 0.92. Classifiers built on RNASeq data performed similarly to microarrays, using the latter set of labels. CONCLUSIONS. A preliminary classifier shows promise in differentiating ILDs on surgical tissue using consensus pathologic pattern diagnosis alone or in combination with clinical assessment. Additional analyses will be aimed towards understanding the performance of classifiers when pathology labels are inconsistent with clinical assessment. Further development of the molecular test is planned on bronchoscopic biopsies collected in an ongoing multicenter clinical trial with MDT review.

N2  - In March 2012, an algorithm for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures of the hip was introduced in our academic department of Orthopaedic Surgery. It included the use of specified implants for particular patterns of fracture. In this cohort study, 102 consecutive patients presenting with an intertrochanteric fracture were followed prospectively (postalgorithm group). Another 117 consecutive patients who had been treated immediately prior to the implementation of the algorithm were identified retrospectively as a control group (pre-Algorithm group). The total cost of the implants prior to implementation of the algorithm was $357 457 (mean: $3055 (1947 to 4133)); compared with $255 120 (mean: $2501 (1052 to 4133)) after its implementation. There was a trend toward fewer complications in patients who were treated using the algorithm (33% pre- versus 22.5% post-Algorithm; p = 0.088). Application of the algorithm to the pre-Algorithm group revealed a potential overall cost saving of $70 295. The implementation of an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures reduced costs while maintaining quality of care with a lower rate of complications and re-Admissions.
