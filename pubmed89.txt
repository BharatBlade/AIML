AB  - High methane and salt levels in groundwater have been the most widely cited 
      unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) related water impairments. The 
      attribution of these contaminants to UOGD is usually complex, especially in 
      regions with mixed land uses. Here, we compiled a large hydrogeochemistry dataset 
      containing 13 geochemical analytes for 17,794 groundwater samples from rural 
      northern Appalachia, i.e., 19 counties located on the boundary between 
      Pennsylvania (PA; UOGD is permitted) and New York (NY; UOGD is banned). With this 
      dataset, we explored if statistical and geospatial tools can help shed light on 
      the sources of inorganic solutes and methane in groundwater in regions with mixed 
      land uses. The traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicates salts in 
      NY and PA groundwater are mainly from the Appalachian Basin Brine (ABB). In 
      contrast, the machine learning tool - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) 
      highlights that road salts (in addition to ABB) account for 36%-48% of total 
      chloride in NY and PA groundwaters. The PCA fails to identify road salts as one 
      water/salt source, likely due to its geochemical similarity with ABB. Neither PCA 
      nor NMF detects a regional impact of UOGD on groundwater quality. Our geospatial 
      analyses further corroborate (1) road salting is the major salt source in 
      groundwater, and its impact is enhanced in proximity to highways; (2) 
      UOGD-related groundwater quality deterioration is only limited to a few 
      localities in PA.

TI  - Outcomes of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in T Cell 
      Prolymphocytic Leukemia: A Contemporary Analysis from the Center for 
      International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research.

AB  - T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with 
      limited treatment options and poor long-term survival. Previous studies of 
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for T-PLL are limited by 
      small numbers, and descriptions of patient and transplantation characteristics 
      and outcomes after alloHCT are sparse. In this study, we evaluated outcomes of 
      alloHCT in patients with T-PLL and attempted to identify predictors of 
      post-transplantation relapse and survival. We conducted an analysis of data using 
      the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database on 266 
      patients with T-PLL who underwent alloHCT between 2008 and 2018. The 4-year rates 
      of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse, and 
      treatment-related mortality (TRM) were 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.8% 
      to 36.5%), 25.7% (95% CI, 20% to 32%), 41.9% (95% CI, 35.5% to 48.4%), and 32.4% 
      (95% CI, 26.4% to 38.6%), respectively. In multivariable analyses, 3 variables 
      were associated with inferior OS: receipt of a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) 
      regimen (hazard ratio [HR], 2.18; P < .0001), age >60 years (HR, 1.61; 
      P = .0053), and suboptimal performance status, defined by Karnofsky Performance 
      Status (KPS) <90 (HR, 1.53; P = .0073). Receipt of an MAC regimen also was 
      associated with increased TRM (HR, 3.31; P < .0001), an elevated cumulative 
      incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR, 2.94; P = .0011), 
      and inferior DFS (HR, 1.86; P = .0004). Conditioning intensity was not associated 
      with relapse; however, stable disease/progression was correlated with increased 
      risk of relapse (HR, 2.13; P = .0072). Both in vivo T cell depletion (TCD) as 
      part of conditioning and KPS <90 were associated with worse TRM and inferior DFS. 
      Receipt of total body irradiation had no significant effect on OS, DFS, or TRM. 
      Our data show that reduced-intensity conditioning without in vivo TCD (ie, 
      without antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab) before alloHCT was associated with 
      long-term DFS in patients with T-PLL who were age ≤60 years or who had a KPS >90 
      or chemosensitive disease.

TI  - Real-World Comprehensive Genomic Profiling Success Rates in Tissue and Liquid 
      Prostate Carcinoma Specimens.

AB  - Challenges with sequencing tissue samples from patients with prostate cancer have 
      been reported in clinical trials. To assess the success rate of comprehensive 
      genomic profiling (CGP) for prostate cancer patients, we analyzed a real-world 
      cohort who underwent sequencing of their prostate tissue sample as well as a 
      subset of patients with a reflex liquid biopsy. Overall, a significant majority 
      (82%) of tissue prostate carcinoma samples yielded reportable CGP results. Of 
      those samples that were unsuccessful, most (75%) were inadequate samples that did 
      not meet pre-established criteria to advance into sequencing. For cases where 
      liquid CGP was performed if tissue CGP was unsuccessful, mutations that were 
      likely attributable to prostate carcinoma were observed in most cases and all 
      cases were successful in generating a report. These results suggest that, for CGP 
      testing, prostate cancer tissue is a reasonable matrix type and that liquid 
      samples can be effectively used as an alternative to tissue.

TI  - Predictive Model Evaluating Risk of Hemorrhage in Intracranial Aneurysms: 
      Analysis from Prospectively Collected HEAT Trial Database.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the data of patients enrolled in the Hydrogel Endovascular 
      Aneurysm Treatment (HEAT) trial to develop and validate a model to predict the 
      risk of aneurysmal hemorrhage. METHODS: Analysis included data from 600 patients 
      enrolled for the HEAT trial and included single saccular aneurysms of 3-14 mm 
      size. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with ruptured and 
      unruptured aneurysms. Regression analysis was performed in the training set to 
      identify significant risk factors and was validated in the validation dataset. 
      The complete dataset was used to formulate a scoring model in which positive and 
      negative predictors were assigned 1 and -1 points, respectively. RESULTS: Data 
      from 593 patients were analyzed in which 169 (28.5%) patients had ruptured 
      aneurysms. The training (n = 297) and validation dataset (n = 296) had a 
      comparable proportion of ruptured aneurysms (29.3% and 27.7%). Dome-to-neck ratio 
      >2.5 (odds ratio [OR] 3.66), irregular shape (OR 3.79), daughter sac (OR 5.89), 
      and anterior and posterior communicating artery locations (OR 3.32 and 3.56, 
      respectively) had a higher rupture rate. Use of aspirin was associated with lower 
      risk of hemorrhage (OR 0.16). The area under the curve from the receiver 
      operating curve analysis was 0.88, 0.87, and 0.87 in the training, validation, 
      and combined data set, respectively. The scoring model created a score of -1 to 
      2, yielding an of aneurysmal hemorrhage probability from 1.5% (score -1) to 70% 
      (score 2). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study identifies dome-to-neck ratio 
      >2.5, irregular shape, presence of daughter sac, absence of aspirin use, and 
      aneurysm location at anterior communicating and posterior communicating artery as 
      factors associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic presentation in small- to 
      medium-sized intracranial aneurysms. Our model provides an estimate of rupture 
      risk based on the presence or absence of these factors.

      Corpora.
PG  - 1986-2009
LID - 10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00343 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Publicly available speech corpora facilitate reproducible research by 
      providing open-access data for participants who have consented/assented to data 
      sharing among different research teams. Such corpora can also support clinical 
      education, including perceptual training and training in the use of speech 
      analysis tools. PURPOSE: In this research note, we introduce the PERCEPT 
      (Perceptual Error Rating for the Clinical Evaluation of Phonetic Targets) 
      corpora, PERCEPT-R (Rhotics) and PERCEPT-GFTA (Goldman-Fristoe Test of 
      Articulation), which together contain over 36 hr of speech audio (> 125,000 
      syllable, word, and phrase utterances) from children, adolescents, and young 
      adults aged 6-24 years with speech sound disorder (primarily residual speech 
      sound disorders impacting /ɹ/) and age-matched peers. We highlight PhonBank as 
      the repository for the corpora and demonstrate use of the associated speech 
      analysis software, Phon, to query PERCEPT-R. A worked example of research with 
      PERCEPT-R, suitable for clinical education and research training, is included as 
      an appendix. Support for end users and information/descriptive statistics for 
      future releases of the PERCEPT corpora can be found in a dedicated Slack channel. 
      Finally, we discuss the potential for PERCEPT corpora to support the training of 
      artificial intelligence clinical speech technology appropriate for use with 
      children with speech sound disorders, the development of which has historically 
      been constrained by the limited representation of either children or individuals 
      with speech impairments in publicly available training corpora. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      demonstrate the use of PERCEPT corpora, PhonBank, and Phon for clinical training 
      and research questions appropriate to child citation speech. Increased use of 
      these tools has the potential to enhance reproducibility in the study of speech 
      development and disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from 
      hospitalized children and to determine the concordance between colonizing and 
      invasive isolates. STUDY DESIGN: Children with culture-confirmed, 
      community-onset, invasive S aureus infections were enrolled in this prospective 
      case series from a large children's hospital over a 5-year period. Colonization 
      isolates were obtained from the anterior nares, oropharynx, and inguinal folds 
      and were compared with invasive isolates via repetitive-element, sequence-based 
      polymerase chain reaction testing. Isolates with a ≥96% genetic match were 
      characterized as concordant. RESULTS: A total of 86 S aureus isolates (44 
      invasive, 42 colonization) were collected from 44 children with invasive 
      infections. Clinical isolates were genetically diverse, 64% of invasive isolates 
      were methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA), and 59% of cases had a colonizing S 
      aureus isolate at the time of hospitalization. Of those who were colonized, at 
      least 1 of their colonization isolates was indistinguishable from the infecting 
      isolate in 88% of cases. Patients with invasive MSSA were significantly more 
      likely to have a concordant MSSA colonization isolate present compared with 
      patients with invasive methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) (61% vs 38%, 
      P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Invasive MSSA infection was more common than MRSA 
      infection in this pediatric cohort, and patients with MSSA infection were 
      significantly more likely than those with MRSA infection to have concordant 
      colonizing isolates across multiple anatomic sites. These findings warrant larger 
      scale validation and may have important infection control and epidemiologic 
      implications, as unlike MRSA, transmissibility of MSSA largely is ignored in 
      healthcare settings.

TI  - Chylous Ascites After Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy: Is Early 
      Surgical Intervention Necessary?
PG  - 397-407
LID - 10.6002/ect.2023.0041 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chylous ascites is a rare complication that may occur after living 
      donor nephrectomy. The continuous loss of lymphatics, which carries a high risk 
      of morbidity, may ensue in possible immunodeficiency and protein-calorie 
      malnutrition. Here, we presented patients who developed chylous ascites after 
      robotassisted living donor nephrectomy and reviewed the current literature of 
      therapeutic strategies for chylous ascites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 
      the medical records of 424 laparoscopic living donor nephrectomies performed at a 
      single transplant center; among these, we studied the records of 3 patients who 
      developed chylous ascites following robot-assisted living donor nephrectomy. 
      RESULTS: Among 438 living donor nephrectomies, 359 (81.9%) were laparoscopic and 
      77 (18.1%) were by robotic assistance. In the 3 cases highlighted in our study, 
      patient 1 did not respond to conservative therapy, which consisted of diet 
      optimization, total parenteral nutrition, and octreotide (somatostatin). Patient 
      1 subsequently underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopy with suture ligation and 
      clipping of leaking lymphatic vessels, allowing the chylous ascites to subside. 
      Patient 2 similarly did not respond to conservative treatment and developed 
      ascites. Despite initial improvement after wound interrogation and drainage, 
      patient 2 had continued symptoms, resulting in diagnostic laparoscopy and repair 
      of leaky channels leading to the cisterna chyli. Patient 3 developed chylous 
      ascites 4 weeks postoperatively and received ultrasonographic-guided paracentesis 
      by interventional radiology, with results showing an aspirate consistent with 
      chyle. The patient's diet was optimized, allowing for initial improvement and 
      eventual return to normal diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series and literature 
      review demonstrate the importance of early surgical intervention after failed 
      conservative management for resolution of chylous ascites in patients after 
      robotassisted donor laparoscopic nephrectomy.

AB  - A common limitation of neuroimaging studies is their small sample sizes. To 
      overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis 
      (ENIGMA) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. 
      However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and 
      sequences. ENIGMA projects commonly address this heterogeneity with 
      random-effects meta-analysis or mixed-effects mega-analysis. Here we tested 
      whether the batch adjustment method, ComBat, can further reduce site-related 
      heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects 
      meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and ComBat mega-analyses to compare 
      cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals 
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. 
      Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia 
      and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of ComBat substantially 
      increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to 
      random-effects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing 
      ComBat with mixed-effects mega-analysis, although ComBat still slightly increased 
      the statistical significance. ComBat also showed increased statistical power when 
      we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we 
      applied the ComBat harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical 
      surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the ComBat 
      function to attenuate potential effects of site in ENIGMA projects and other 
      multi-site structural imaging work. We provide easy-to-use functions in R that 
      work even if imaging data are partially missing in some brain regions, and they 
      can be trained with one data set and then applied to another (a requirement for 
      some analyses such as machine learning).

LID - e14489
AB  - Factor V Leiden deficiency, the most common inherited thrombophilia, is a risk 
      factor for venous thromboembolism in both the heterozygous and homozygous forms. 
      An autosomal dominant genetic condition, the pattern of incomplete penetrance 
      leads to variable manifestations of the disease. The association with arterial 
      thromboembolism remains controversial, with studies indicating modest increases 
      in risk of coronary artery disease, stroke. We present the case of a 53-year-old 
      male with Wellens syndrome, with a history of heterozygous factor V Leiden 
      deficiency and no other risk factors. Coronary angiography found a complete total 
      occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, with established 
      collaterals, ultimately requiring coronary artery bypass graft. Laboratory 
      testing effectively eliminated the presence of any alternative known risk factors 
      for the advanced coronary artery disease. The literature evaluating a possible 
      link between factor V Leiden deficiency and atherosclerosis remain conflicting. 
      Our case highlights a concerning association and need for further studies.

      Variants in the CLN Genes.
PG  - 23

LID - 23
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the phenotype of CLN-associated retinal dystrophy in a 
      subset of patients at the Columbia University Medical Center, United States, and 
      the Hospital das Clínicas de Pernambuco, Brazil, in comparison to the published 
      literature. METHODS: Eleven patients with confirmed biallelic variants in the CLN 
      genes were evaluated via dilated fundus examination, clinical imaging, and 
      full-field electroretinogram. A thorough literature search was conducted to 
      determine previously published variants and associated phenotypes. RESULTS: 
      Genetic testing confirmed the presence of variants in CLN3, CLN7/MFSD8, CLN8, and 
      GRN/CLN11. Five novel variants were identified, and four novel phenotypes of 
      previously published alleles were described. The phenotype differed among 
      patients with variants in the same gene and sometimes among patients with the 
      same allele. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial phenotypic variability among variants in 
      the CLN genes makes identification of genotype-phenotype or allele-phenotype 
      correlations challenging. Further study is required to establish an extensive 
      database for adequate patient counseling.

AB  - Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease is a very rare 
      neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. Progression is rapid and 
      irreversible, making early diagnosis crucial for timely treatment. A group of 
      pediatric neurologists and neuroradiologists with expertise in CLN2 convened to 
      discuss early electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      findings in CLN2 diagnosis. Of 18 CLN2 cases, 16 (88.9%) had background slowing 
      and 16 (88.9%) had epileptiform discharges on initial EEG. Seven of 17 (41.2%) 
      patients who received intermittent low-frequency photic stimulation had a 
      photoparoxysmal response. Initial MRIs showed subtle cerebellar (n = 14, 77.8%) 
      or cerebral (n = 9, 50.0%) atrophy, white matter abnormalities (n = 11, 61.1%), 
      and basal ganglia T2 hypointensity (n = 6, 33.3%), which became more apparent on 
      follow-up MRI. The recognition of even subtle cerebellar atrophy and white matter 
      signal changes in children aged 2-5 years who present with language delay, 
      new-onset seizures, and an EEG with epileptiform discharges and background 
      slowing should prompt investigation for CLN2. Because these early signs are not 
      unique to CLN2, genetic testing is essential early in the diagnostic journey.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prediction of malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MMI) could 
      identify patients for early intervention. We trained and internally validated a 
      ML model that predicts MMI following mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for ACLVO. 
      METHODS: All patients who underwent MT for ACLVO between 2015 - 2021 at a single 
      institution were reviewed. Data was divided into 80% training and 20% test sets. 
      10 models were evaluated on the training set. The top 3 models underwent 
      hyperparameter tuning using grid search with nested 5-fold CV to optimize the 
      area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Tuned models were evaluated on 
      the test set and compared to logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 381 
      patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 50 (13.1%) patients who developed 
      MMI. Out of the 10 ML models screened on the training set, the top 3 performing 
      were neural network (median AUROC 0.78, IQR 0.72 - 0.83), support vector machine 
      ([SVM] median AUROC 0.77, IQR 0.72 - 0.83), and random forest (median AUROC 0.75, 
      IQR 0.68 - 0.81). On the test set, random forest (median AUROC 0.78, IQR 0.73 - 
      0.83) and neural network (median AUROC 0.78, IQR 0.73 - 0.83) were the top 
      performing models, followed by SVM (median AUROC 0.77, IQR 0.70 - 0.83). These 
      scores were significantly better than those for logistic regression (AUROC 0.72, 
      IQR 0.66 - 0.78), individual risk factors, and the Malignant Brain Edema score (p 
      < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: ML models predicted MMI with good discriminative 
      ability. They outperformed standard statistical techniques and individual risk 
      factors.

PG  - 479-485
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0000000000001673 [doi]
AB  - There are subsets of patients whose presentations elude a precise diagnosis. All 
      diagnoses are asymptotic to nature as they are constructs imposed on the world. 
      Nonetheless, a greater degree of accuracy and precision is possible and 
      beneficial for most patients. This is particularly true for patients with 
      borderline personality organization (BPO) who present with psychotic symptoms. 
      For the purposes of avoiding a misconstrual of the meaning of psychotic 
      experiences in these patients, a brief synopsis of borderline personality 
      organization, in contradistinction to borderline personality disorder, may prove 
      to be of some clinical utility. The BPO construct presciently anticipates the 
      trend toward a dimensional model of personality disorders and has the potential 
      to enrich and inform these developments.

TI  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria associated with Myo1E 
      mutations: novel variants and histological phenotype analysis.
PG  - 439-449
LID - 10.1007/s00467-022-05634-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenic mutations in the non-muscle single-headed myosin, myosin 
      1E (Myo1e), are a rare cause of pediatric focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
      (FSGS). These mutations are biallelic, to date only reported as homozygous 
      variants in consanguineous families. Myo1e regulates the actin cytoskeleton 
      dynamics and cell adhesion, which are especially important for podocyte 
      functions. METHODS: DNA and RNA sequencing were used to identify novel MYO1E 
      variants associated with FSGS. We studied the effects of these variants on the 
      localization of Myo1e in kidney sections. We then analyzed the clinical and 
      histological observations of all known pathogenic MYO1E variants. RESULTS: We 
      identified a patient compound heterozygote for two novel variants in MYO1E and a 
      patient homozygous for a deletion of exon 19. Computer modeling predicted these 
      variants to be disruptive. In both patients, Myo1e was mislocalized. As a rule, 
      pathogenic MYO1E variants map to the Myo1e motor and neck domain and are most 
      often associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children 1-11 years 
      of age, leading to kidney failure in 4-10 years in a subset of patients. The 
      ultrastructural features are the podocyte damage and striking diffuse and global 
      Alport-like glomerular basement membrane (GBM) abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      hypothesize that MYO1E mutations lead to disruption of the function of podocyte 
      contractile actin cables resulting in abnormalities of the podocytes and the GBM 
      and dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier. The characteristic 
      clinicopathological data can help to tentatively differentiate this condition 
      from other genetic podocytopathies and Alport syndrome until genetic testing is 
      done. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as 
      Supplementary information.

TI  - Clinicopathologic Features of a Series of Primary Renal CIC-rearranged Sarcomas 
      With Comprehensive Molecular Analysis.
PG  - 1360-1369
LID - 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001098 [doi]
AB  - CIC-rearranged sarcomas rarely occur in visceral organs including the kidney. The 
      most common fusion partner with CIC is the DUX4 gene, but variant fusion partners 
      have also been reported. Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic features and 
      comprehensive molecular profiling of 4 cases of primary renal CIC-rearranged 
      sarcomas. All cases occurred in females, age range 13 to 82 years and included 3 
      resections and 1 needle biopsy specimen. There was a tendency for development of 
      metastatic disease predominantly to the lungs and poor disease outcome despite 
      different treatment strategies. Histologically, variable round cell (20% to 
      100%), spindle cell (0% to 80%), and rhabdoid morphologies (0% to 20%) were seen. 
      By immunohistochemistry diffuse WT1 nuclear (2 to 3+, ∼90%) labeling was present 
      in 1 case, with cytoplasmic staining in the others (3+, 40% to 75%). CD99 was 
      focally positive in all 4 cases (≤10%); 1 case each was diffusely positive for 
      c-myc (2 to 3+, ∼90%) and ETV4 (3+, ∼90%); 1 case was focally positive for c-myc 
      (2+, ∼5%) and calretinin (2+, ∼5%); and all cases were negative for cytokeratin 
      and NKX2.2. CIC rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization was present 
      in the 3 cases tested. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 3 cases revealed 
      a CIC-DUX4 fusion in 2 cases, and 1 CIC-NUTM1 fusion. All 4 CIC-rearranged renal 
      sarcomas had low mutation burden, and except HLA-A and MLL mutations lacked 
      genomic alterations in other oncogenic drivers. Material from the needle biopsy 
      was insufficient for CGP but that case was positive with the DUX4 
      immunohistochemical stain as were the 2 CIC-DUX4 tumors. In conclusion, 
      CIC-rearranged sarcomas rarely occur in the kidney with a tendency for poor 
      outcome and in this series we illustrate an example with CIC-NUTM1 fusion, an 
      emerging variant, at a visceral site. Testing by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization or CGP is optimal to avoid missing cases that harbor variant fusion 
      partners.

AB  - Machine learning plays a major role in many scientific investigations. However, 
      non-expert programmers may struggle to implement the elaborate pipelines 
      necessary to build highly accurate and generalizable models. We introduce exprso, 
      a new R package that is an intuitive machine learning suite designed specifically 
      for non-expert programmers. Built initially for the classification of 
      high-dimensional data, exprso uses an object-oriented framework to encapsulate a 
      number of common analytical methods into a series of interchangeable modules. 
      This includes modules for feature selection, classification, high-throughput 
      parameter grid-searching, elaborate cross-validation schemes (e.g., Monte Carlo 
      and nested cross-validation), ensemble classification, and prediction. In 
      addition, exprso also supports multi-class classification (through the 1-vs-all 
      generalization of binary classifiers) and the prediction of continuous outcomes.

TI  - Evolutionary Proteomics Reveals Distinct Patterns of Complexity and Divergence 
      between Lepidopteran Sperm Morphs.
PG  - 1838-1846
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evz080 [doi]
AB  - Spermatozoa are one of the most strikingly diverse animal cell types. One poorly 
      understood example of this diversity is sperm heteromorphism, where males produce 
      multiple distinct morphs of sperm in a single ejaculate. Typically, only one 
      morph is capable of fertilization and the function of the nonfertilizing morph, 
      called parasperm, remains to be elucidated. Sperm heteromorphism has multiple 
      independent origins, including Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), where males 
      produce a fertilizing eupyrene sperm and an apyrene parasperm, which lacks a 
      nucleus and nuclear DNA. Here we report a comparative proteomic analysis of 
      eupyrene and apyrene sperm between two distantly related lepidopteran species, 
      the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Carolina sphinx moth (Manduca 
      sexta). In both species, we identified ∼700 sperm proteins, with half present in 
      both morphs and the majority of the remainder observed only in eupyrene sperm. 
      Apyrene sperm thus have a distinctly less complex proteome. Gene ontology (GO) 
      analysis revealed proteins shared between morphs tend to be associated with 
      canonical sperm cell structures (e.g., flagellum) and metabolism (e.g., ATP 
      production). GO terms for morph-specific proteins broadly reflect known 
      structural differences, but also suggest a role for apyrene sperm in modulating 
      female neurobiology. Comparative analysis indicates that proteins shared between 
      morphs are most conserved between species as components of sperm, whereas 
      morph-specific proteins turn over more quickly, especially in apyrene sperm. The 
      rapid divergence of apyrene sperm content is consistent with a relaxation of 
      selective constraints associated with fertilization and karyogamy. On the other 
      hand, parasperm generally exhibit greater evolutionary lability, and our 
      observations may therefore reflect adaptive responses to shifting regimes of 
      sexual selection.

TI  - Kalpra: A kernel approach for longitudinal pathway regression analysis 
      integrating network information with an application to the longitudinal PsyCourse 
      Study.
PG  - 1015885
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.1015885 [doi]
LID - 1015885
AB  - A popular approach to reduce the high dimensionality resulting from genome-wide 
      association studies is to analyze a whole pathway in a single test for 
      association with a phenotype. Kernel machine regression (KMR) is a highly 
      flexible pathway analysis approach. Initially, KMR was developed to analyze a 
      simple phenotype with just one measurement per individual. Recently, however, the 
      investigation into the influence of genomic factors in the development of 
      disease-related phenotypes across time (trajectories) has gained in importance. 
      Thus, novel statistical approaches for KMR analyzing longitudinal data, i.e. 
      several measurements at specific time points per individual are required. For 
      longitudinal pathway analysis, we extend KMR to long-KMR using the estimation 
      equivalence of KMR and linear mixed models. We include additional random effects 
      to correct for the dependence structure. Moreover, within long-KMR we created a 
      topology-based pathway analysis by combining this approach with a kernel 
      including network information of the pathway. Most importantly, long-KMR not only 
      allows for the investigation of the main genetic effect adjusting for time 
      dependencies within an individual, but it also allows to test for the association 
      of the pathway with the longitudinal course of the phenotype in the form of 
      testing the genetic time-interaction effect. The approach is implemented as an R 
      package, kalpra. Our simulation study demonstrates that the power of long-KMR 
      exceeded that of another KMR method previously developed to analyze longitudinal 
      data, while maintaining (slightly conservatively) the type I error. The network 
      kernel improved the performance of long-KMR compared to the linear kernel. 
      Considering different pathway densities, the power of the network kernel 
      decreased with increasing pathway density. We applied long-KMR to cognitive data 
      on executive function (Trail Making Test, part B) from the PsyCourse Study and 17 
      candidate pathways selected from Reactome. We identified seven nominally 
      significant pathways.

AB  - CADASIL is Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and 
      Leukoencephalopathy [corrected]. (CADASIL) is sometimes misdiagnosed as multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). MS and CADASIL are not known to co-occur and brain magnetic 
      resonance imagining (MRI) findings can help with differential diagnosis. Despite 
      the availability of this information, a case report is presented of a 61-year-old 
      woman who was misdiagnosed with MS at age 50, tested positive for CADASIL at age 
      56, described incorrectly as having both conditions simultaneously, and continued 
      on MS disease-modifying medications, resulting in financial and physical 
      hardship. Neuropsychological consultation helped initiate removal of the MS 
      diagnosis and treatment. Better understanding is needed among clinicians that MS 
      and CADASIL are not known to co-exist, that no association has been found between 
      MS and the NOTCH3 mutations that cause CADASIL, and that neuroimaging and 
      clinical features can help distinguish between the two conditions in addition to 
      genetic testing. This case study highlights how neuropsychological consultation 
      involves more than testing, can help improve diagnostic decision making, and can 
      improve outcomes by reducing costs to the patient and the healthcare system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and 
      neuropathological findings in support of the first diagnosis of lethal, 
      small-vessel cerebral vasculitis triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a pediatric patient. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: A 
      previously healthy, eight-year-old Hispanic girl presented with subacute 
      left-sided weakness two weeks after a mild febrile illness. SARS-CoV-2 
      nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an 
      enhancing right frontal lobe lesion with significant vasogenic edema. Two brain 
      biopsies of the lesion showed perivascular and intraluminal lymphohistiocytic 
      inflammatory infiltrate consistent with vasculitis. Despite extensive treatment 
      with immunomodulatory therapies targeting primary angiitis of the central nervous 
      system, she experienced neurological decline and died 93 days after presentation. 
      SARS-CoV-2 testing revealed positive serum IgG and positive cerebrospinal fluid 
      IgM. Comprehensive infectious, rheumatologic, hematologic/oncologic, and genetic 
      evaluation did not identify an alternative etiology. Postmortem brain autopsy 
      remained consistent with vasculitis. CONCLUSION: This is the first pediatric 
      presentation to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a fatal, postinfectious, 
      inflammatory small-vessel cerebral vasculitis. Our patient uniquely included 
      supportive cerebrospinal fluid and postmortem tissue analysis. While most 
      children recover from the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2, we emphasize 
      the potential mortality in a child with no risk factors for severe disease.

TI  - Real-world experience with obeticholic acid in patients with primary biliary 
      cholangitis.
PG  - 100248
LID - 10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100248 [doi]
LID - 100248
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obeticholic acid (OCA) is the second-line treatment approved 
      for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and an inadequate response or 
      intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and 
      safety of OCA under real-world conditions. METHODS: Patients were recruited into 
      the Italian PBC Registry, a multicentre, observational cohort study that monitors 
      patients with PBC at national level. The primary endpoint was the biochemical 
      response according to Poise criteria; the secondary endpoint was the biochemical 
      response according to normal range criteria, defined as normal levels of 
      bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 12 
      months. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS: We analysed 191 
      patients until at least 12 months of follow-up. Median age was 57 years, 94% 
      female, 61 (32%) had cirrhosis, 28 (15%) had histologically proven overlap with 
      autoimmune hepatitis (PBC-AIH). At 12 months, significant median reductions of 
      ALP (-32.3%), ALT (-31.4%), and bilirubin (-11.2%) were observed. Response rates 
      were 42.9% according to Poise criteria, and 11% by normal range criteria. 
      Patients with cirrhosis had lower response than patients without cirrhosis (29.5% 
      vs. 49.2%, p = 0.01), owing to a higher rate of OCA discontinuation (30% vs. 12%, 
      p = 0.004), although with similar ALP reduction (29.4% vs. 34%, p = 0.53). 
      Overlap PBC-AIH had a similar response to pure PBC (46.4% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.68), 
      with higher ALT reduction at 6 months (-38% vs. -29%, p = 0.04). Thirty-three 
      patients (17%) prematurely discontinued OCA because of adverse events, of whom 11 
      experienced serious adverse events. Treatment-induced pruritus was the leading 
      cause of OCA discontinuation (67%). CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness and safety of OCA 
      under real-world conditions mirror those in the Poise trial. Patients with 
      cirrhosis had lower tolerability. Overlap PBC-AIH showed higher ALT reduction at 
      6 months compared with patients with pure PBC. LAY SUMMARY: Obeticholic acid 
      (OCA) was shown to be effective in more than one-third of patients not responding 
      to ursodeoxycholic acid in a real-world context in Italy. Patients with cirrhosis 
      had more side effects with OCA, and this led to suspension of the drug in 
      one-third of patients. OCA was also effective in patients who had overlap between 
      autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis.

TI  - Efficacy of bendamustine and rituximab in unfit patients with previously

AB  - Limited information is available on the efficacy of front-line bendamustine and 
      rituximab (BR) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with reduced renal function 
      or coexisting conditions. We therefore analyzed a cohort of real-world patients 
      and performed a matched adjusted indirect comparison with a cohort of patients 
      treated with ibrutinib. One hundred and fifty-seven patients with creatinine 
      clearance (CrCl) <70 mL/min and/or CIRS score >6 were treated with BR. The median 
      age was 72 years; 69% of patients had ≥2 comorbidities and the median CrCl was 
      59.8 mL/min. 17.6% of patients carried TP53 disruption. The median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) was 45 months; TP53 disruption was associated 
      with a shorter PFS (P = 0.05). The overall survival (OS) at 12, 24, and 36 months 
      was 96.2%, 90.1%, and 79.5%, respectively. TP53 disruption was associated with an 
      increased risk of death (P = 0.01). Data on 162 patients ≥65 years treated with 
      ibrutinib were analyzed and compared with 165 patients ≥65 years treated with BR. 
      Factors predicting for a longer PFS at multivariable analysis in the total 
      patient population treated with BR and ibrutinib were age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 
      1.02-1.10, P < 0.01) and treatment with ibrutinib (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.93, 
      P = 0.03). In a post hoc analysis of patients in advanced stage, a significant 
      PFS advantage was observed in patient who had received ibrutinib (P = 0.03), who 
      showed a trend for OS advantage (P = 0.08). We arrived at the following 
      conclusions: (a) BR is a relatively effective first-line regimen in a real-world 
      population of unfit patients without TP53 disruption, (b) ibrutinib provided 
      longer disease control than BR in patients with advanced disease stage.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Based PTEN Loss Assessment as an Early Predictor of 
      Prostate Cancer Metastasis After Surgery: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.

AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is associated with adverse outcomes in 
      prostate cancer and can be measured via immunohistochemistry. The purpose of the 
      study was to establish the clinical application of an in-house developed 
      artificial intelligence (AI) image analysis workflow for automated detection of 
      PTEN loss on digital images for identifying patients at risk of early recurrence 
      and metastasis. Postsurgical tissue microarray sections from the Canary 
      Foundation (n = 1264) stained with anti-PTEN antibody were evaluated 
      independently by pathologist conventional visual scoring (cPTEN) and an automated 
      AI-based image analysis pipeline (AI-PTEN). The relationship of PTEN evaluation 
      methods with cancer recurrence and metastasis was analyzed using multivariable 
      Cox proportional hazard and decision curve models. Both cPTEN scoring by the 
      pathologist and quantification of PTEN loss by AI (high-risk AI-qPTEN) were 
      significantly associated with shorter metastasis-free survival (MFS) in 
      univariable analysis (cPTEN hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; CI, 1.07-2.21; P = .019; 
      AI-qPTEN HR, 2.55; CI, 1.83-3.56; P < .001). In multivariable analyses, AI-qPTEN 
      showed a statistically significant association with shorter MFS (HR, 2.17; CI, 
      1.49-3.17; P < .001) and recurrence-free survival (HR, 1.36; CI, 1.06-1.75; P = 
      .016) when adjusting for relevant postsurgical clinical nomogram (Cancer of the 
      Prostate Risk Assessment [CAPRA] postsurgical score [CAPRA-S]), whereas cPTEN 
      does not show a statistically significant association (HR, 1.33; CI, 0.89-2; P = 
      .2 and HR, 1.26; CI, 0.99-1.62; P = .063, respectively) when adjusting for 
      CAPRA-S risk stratification. More importantly, AI-qPTEN was associated with 
      shorter MFS in patients with favorable pathological stage and negative surgical 
      margins (HR, 2.72; CI, 1.46-5.06; P = .002). Workflow also demonstrated enhanced 
      clinical utility in decision curve analysis, more accurately identifying men who 
      might benefit from adjuvant therapy postsurgery. This study demonstrates the 
      clinical value of an affordable and fully automated AI-powered PTEN assessment 
      for evaluating the risk of developing metastasis or disease recurrence after 
      radical prostatectomy. Adding the AI-qPTEN assessment workflow to clinical 
      variables may affect postoperative surveillance or management options, 
      particularly in low-risk patients.

AB  - The application of microarray technology in schizophrenia research was heralded 
      as paradigm-shifting, as it allowed for high-throughput assessment of cell and 
      tissue function. This technology was widely adopted, initially in studies of 
      postmortem brain tissue, and later in studies of peripheral blood. The collective 
      body of schizophrenia microarray literature contains apparent inconsistencies 
      between studies, with failures to replicate top hits, in part due to small sample 
      sizes, cohort-specific effects, differences in array types, and other 
      confounders. In an attempt to summarize existing studies of schizophrenia cases 
      and non-related comparison subjects, we performed two mega-analyses of a combined 
      set of microarray data from postmortem prefrontal cortices (n=315) and from 
      ex-vivo blood tissues (n=578). We adjusted regression models per gene to remove 
      non-significant covariates, providing best-estimates of transcripts dysregulated 
      in schizophrenia. We also examined dysregulation of functionally related gene 
      sets and gene co-expression modules, and assessed enrichment of cell types and 
      genetic risk factors. The identities of the most significantly dysregulated genes 
      were largely distinct for each tissue, but the findings indicated common emergent 
      biological functions (e.g. immunity) and regulatory factors (e.g., predicted 
      targets of transcription factors and miRNA species across tissues). Our 
      network-based analyses converged upon similar patterns of heightened innate 
      immune gene expression in both brain and blood in schizophrenia. We also 
      constructed generalizable machine-learning classifiers using the blood-based 
      microarray data. Our study provides an informative atlas for future 
      pathophysiologic and biomarker studies of schizophrenia.

AB  - This article presents a synthetic distracted driving (SynDD1) dataset for machine 
      learning models to detect and analyze drivers' various distracted behavior and 
      different gaze zones. We collected the data in a stationary vehicle using three 
      in-vehicle cameras positioned at locations: on the dashboard, near the rearview 
      mirror, and on the top right-side window corner. The dataset contains two 
      activity types: distracted activities [1], [2], [3], and gaze zones [4], [5], [6] 
      for each participant and each activity type has two sets: without appearance 
      blocks and with appearance blocks, such as wearing a hat or sunglasses. The order 
      and duration of each activity for each participant are random. In addition, the 
      dataset contains manual annotations for each activity, having its start and end 
      time annotated. Researchers could use this dataset to evaluate the performance of 
      machine learning algorithms for the classification of various distracting 
      activities and gaze zones of drivers.

TI  - Novel MFSD8 mutation causing non-syndromic asymmetric adult-onset macular 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 186-190
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2022.2092758 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MFSD8 mutations can cause type 7 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a 
      systemic disorder that includes vision loss; however, such mutations can also 
      cause isolated retinal dystrophy with vision loss without systemic signs or 
      symptoms as first identified in 2015. This report details a previously unreported 
      combination of compound heterozygous variants in the MFSD8 gene causing a 
      non-syndromic, bilateral central macular dystrophy presenting in adulthood. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a case of MFSD8-associated retinal dystrophy 
      with multimodal imaging and a review of relevant literature. RESULTS: A 
      57-year-old female presented for subacute, unilateral blurriness in her right 
      eye. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/250 and 20/50 in the right and left 
      eyes, respectively. Fundus examination and multimodal imaging revealed blunted 
      foveal reflexes and optical gap with subfoveal ellipsoid zone loss in both eyes, 
      right greater than left. Full field electroretinography results were within 
      normal limits while the Arden ratio on electro-oculography was abnormal in both 
      eyes, right more so than left. Genetic testing revealed apparently causative 
      compound heterozygous mutations in the MFSD8 gene: c.154G>A, p.(Gly52Arg) and 
      c.1006G>C, p.(Gluc336Gln). Visual acuity over one year of follow-up has remained 
      stable. CONCLUSIONS: To authors' knowledge, this report is first description of 
      this combination of mutations in the MFSD8 gene leading to non-syndromic 
      adult-onset macular dystrophy.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) was used to determine whether early response can predict 
      efficacy outcome in pediatric subjects with ADHD treated with SPN-812. We used 
      data from four Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials of 100- to 600-mg/day SPN-812 
      (N=1397; 6-17 years of age). The treatment response was defined as having a ≥50% 
      reduction in change from baseline (CFB) in ADHD Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) Total 
      score at Week 6. The variables used were: ADHD-RS-5 Total score, age, body 
      weight, and body mass index at baseline; CFB ADHD-RS-5 Total score at Week 1, 
      cumulative change in ADHD-RS-5 Total score at Week 2, and cumulative change in 
      ADHD-RS-5 Total score at Week 3; Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) 
      score at Week 1, 2, and 3; and target dose. Using the best selected model, lasso 
      regression, to generate importance scores, we found that change in ADHD-RS-5 
      Total score and CGI-I score were the best predictors of efficacy outcome. Change 
      in ADHD-RS-5 Total score at Week 2 could predict treatment response at Week 6 
      (75% positive predictive power, 75% sensitivity, 74% specificity). Therefore, 
      early response after two weeks of treatment with once-daily SPN-812 in pediatric 
      patients with ADHD can predict efficacy outcome at Week 6.

AB  - Precision targeting imaging agents and/or treatment agents to select cells or 
      organs in the body remains a significant need and is an area of intense research. 
      It has been hypothesized that the vitamin B12 (B12) dietary pathway, or 
      components thereof, may be exploitable in this area. The question of whether 
      gastric Intrinsic factor (IF), critical for B12 absorption in the GI tract via 
      the cubilin receptor, could be used as a targeting moiety for the cubilin 
      receptor systemically, has not been investigated. Cubilin is the only known 
      receptor for holo-IF and is found primarily in the kidney and ear (outside of the 
      ileum of the GI) offering significant scope for specific targeting. We utilized 
      plant derived human gastric IF in fluorescent cell and PET based in vivo imaging 
      and biodistribution studies and demonstrated that plant derived IF primarily 
      targets the liver, likely a consequence of the unique glycosylation profile of 
      the IF, and is not affected by endogenous B12 levels.

TI  - Estimation of a Machine Learning-Based Decision Rule to Reduce Hypoglycemia Among 
      Older Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: A Post Hoc Analysis of Continuous Glucose 
      Monitoring in the WISDM Study.
PG  - 19322968221149040
LID - 10.1177/19322968221149040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Wireless Innovation for Seniors with Diabetes Mellitus (WISDM) 
      study demonstrated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) reduced hypoglycemia over 
      6 months among older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared with blood 
      glucose monitoring (BGM). We explored heterogeneous treatment effects of CGM on 
      hypoglycemia by formulating a data-driven decision rule that selects an 
      intervention (ie, CGM vs BGM) to minimize percentage of time <70 mg/dL for each 
      individual WISDM participant. METHOD: The precision medicine analyses used data 
      from participants with complete data (n = 194 older adults, including those who 
      received CGM [n = 100] and BGM [n = 94] in the trial). Policy tree and decision 
      list algorithms were fit with 14 baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory 
      measures. The primary outcome was CGM-measured percentage of time spent in 
      hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dL), and the decision rule assigned participants to a 
      subgroup reflecting the treatment estimated to minimize this outcome across all 
      follow-up visits. RESULTS: The optimal decision rule was found to be a decision 
      list with 3 steps. The first step moved WISDM participants with baseline 
      time-below range >1.35% and no detectable C-peptide levels to the CGM subgroup (n 
      = 139), and the second step moved WISDM participants with a baseline time-below 
      range of >6.45% to the CGM subgroup (n = 18). The remaining participants (n = 37) 
      were left in the BGM subgroup. Compared with the BGM subgroup (n = 37; 19%), the 
      group for whom CGM minimized hypoglycemia (n = 157; 81%) had more baseline 
      hypoglycemia, a lower proportion of detectable C-peptide, higher glycemic 
      variability, longer disease duration, and higher proportion of insulin pump use. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The decision rule underscores the benefits of CGM for older adults 
      to reduce hypoglycemia. Diagnostic CGM and laboratory markers may inform 
      decision-making surrounding therapeutic CGM and identify older adults for whom 
      CGM may be a critical intervention to reduce hypoglycemia.

TI  - Salivary miRNA profiles identify children with autism spectrum disorder, 
      correlate with adaptive behavior, and implicate ASD candidate genes involved in 
      neurodevelopment.
PG  - 52

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental 
      disorder that lacks adequate screening tools, often delaying diagnosis and 
      therapeutic interventions. Despite a substantial genetic component, no single 
      gene variant accounts for >1 % of ASD incidence. Epigenetic mechanisms that 
      include microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the ASD phenotype by altering 
      networks of neurodevelopmental genes. The extracellular availability of miRNAs 
      allows for painless, noninvasive collection from biofluids. In this study, we 
      investigated the potential for saliva-based miRNAs to serve as diagnostic 
      screening tools and evaluated their potential functional importance. METHODS: 
      Salivary miRNA was purified from 24 ASD subjects and 21 age- and gender-matched 
      control subjects. The ASD group included individuals with mild ASD (DSM-5 
      criteria and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and no history of neurologic 
      disorder, pre-term birth, or known chromosomal abnormality. All subjects 
      completed a thorough neurodevelopmental assessment with the Vineland Adaptive 
      Behavior Scales at the time of saliva collection. A total of 246 miRNAs were 
      detected and quantified in at least half the samples by RNA-Seq and used to 
      perform between-group comparisons with non-parametric testing, multivariate 
      logistic regression and classification analyses, as well as Monte-Carlo 
      Cross-Validation (MCCV). The top miRNAs were examined for correlations with 
      measures of adaptive behavior. Functional enrichment analysis of the highest 
      confidence mRNA targets of the top differentially expressed miRNAs was performed 
      using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery 
      (DAVID), as well as the Simons Foundation Autism Database (AutDB) of ASD 
      candidate genes. RESULTS: Fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed in ASD 
      subjects compared to controls (p <0.05; FDR <0.15) and showed more than 95 % 
      accuracy at distinguishing subject groups in the best-fit logistic regression 
      model. MCCV revealed an average ROC-AUC value of 0.92 across 100 simulations, 
      further supporting the robustness of the findings. Most of the 14 miRNAs showed 
      significant correlations with Vineland neurodevelopmental scores. Functional 
      enrichment analysis detected significant over-representation of target gene 
      clusters related to transcriptional activation, neuronal development, and AutDB 
      genes. CONCLUSION: Measurement of salivary miRNA in this pilot study of subjects 
      with mild ASD demonstrated differential expression of 14 miRNAs that are 
      expressed in the developing brain, impact mRNAs related to brain development, and 
      correlate with neurodevelopmental measures of adaptive behavior. These miRNAs 
      have high specificity and cross-validated utility as a potential screening tool 
      for ASD.

AB  - To reveal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetic risk influences on 
      tissue-specific gene expression, we use brain and non-brain transcriptomic 
      imputation. We impute genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) in 29,539 PTSD 
      cases and 166,145 controls from 70 ancestry-specific cohorts and identify 18 
      significant GReX-PTSD associations corresponding to specific tissue-gene pairs. 
      The results suggest substantial genetic heterogeneity based on ancestry, cohort 
      type (military versus civilian), and sex. Two study-wide significant PTSD 
      associations are identified in European and military European cohorts; ZNF140 is 
      predicted to be upregulated in whole blood, and SNRNP35 is predicted to be 
      downregulated in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. In peripheral 
      leukocytes from 175 marines, the observed PTSD differential gene expression 
      correlates with the predicted differences for these individuals, and deployment 
      stress produces glucocorticoid-regulated expression changes that include 
      downregulation of both ZNF140 and SNRNP35. SNRNP35 knockdown in cells validates 
      its functional role in U12-intron splicing. Finally, exogenous glucocorticoids in 
      mice downregulate prefrontal Snrnp35 expression.

TI  - Insights into psychosis risk from leukocyte microRNA expression.
PG  - e981
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.148 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of immune system functions has been implicated in schizophrenia, 
      suggesting that immune cells may be involved in the development of the disorder. 
      With the goal of a biomarker assay for psychosis risk, we performed small RNA 
      sequencing on RNA isolated from circulating immune cells. We compared baseline 
      microRNA (miRNA) expression for persons who were unaffected (n=27) or who, over a 
      subsequent 2-year period, were at clinical high risk but did not progress to 
      psychosis (n=37), or were at high risk and did progress to psychosis (n=30). A 
      greedy algorithm process led to selection of five miRNAs that when summed with +1 
      weights distinguished progressed from nonprogressed subjects with an area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86. Of the five, miR-941 is 
      human-specific with incompletely understood functions, but the other four are 
      prominent in multiple immune system pathways. Three of those four are 
      downregulated in progressed vs. nonprogressed subjects (with weight -1 in a 
      classifier function that increases with risk); all three have also been 
      independently reported as downregulated in monocytes from schizophrenia patients 
      vs. unaffected subjects. Importantly, these findings passed stringent 
      randomization tests that minimized the risk of conclusions arising by chance. 
      Regarding miRNA-miRNA correlations over the three groups, progressed subjects 
      were found to have much weaker miRNA orchestration than nonprogressed or 
      unaffected subjects. If independently verified, the leukocytic miRNA biomarker 
      assay might improve accuracy of psychosis high-risk assessments and eventually 
      help rationalize preventative intervention decisions.

TI  - An institutional review of genomic sequencing in pediatric solid tumors.
PG  - e30324
LID - 10.1002/pbc.30324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although tumor genomic profiling has aided the advancement of 
      targeted genetic therapy, its clinical integration remains a challenge in 
      pediatric cancers due to lower mutation frequency and less available targeted 
      drugs. There have been multiple novel studies examining molecular sequencing in 
      pediatrics; however, many of these studies primarily utilized large-scale, 
      genome-wide screening applications that limit applicable use due to the 
      availability of testing. This study examined the institutional use of a targeted, 
      clinically available approach to tumor genomic sequencing. METHODS: A 
      retrospective chart review was performed on pediatric patients with solid tumors 
      who were managed at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and underwent 
      molecular testing of their tumor biopsy via OmniSeq from August 2016 to July 
      2021. Results were reviewed for mutations considered to be "actionable" by 
      targeted therapy. Patients with actionable mutations were further examined to 
      evaluate treatment course, receival of targeted therapy, and clinical outcomes. 
      RESULTS: We identified 64 pediatric patients consisting of 20 (31%) with CNS 
      tumors and 44 (69%) with non-CNS tumors, ranging in age from 9 months to 21 
      years. Thirty-five total actionable mutations were identified amongst 27 patients 
      (42%). Of these 27, 12 patients (44%) received at least 1 targeted drug against a 
      respective actionable mutation, of which 6 patients (50%) achieved clinical 
      benefit to therapy, including 1 complete response. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 
      clinically focused and readily available targeted molecular sequencing panel 
      identified actionable mutations at a comparable rate to the large-scale, less 
      readily available sequencing panels utilized in other studies. Half of our 
      patients who received targeted therapy achieved a complete response or clinical 
      benefit from therapy. Although targeted therapy has a role in pediatric cancer 
      treatment, many newer drugs require further research on their safety and 
      efficacy.

TI  - GESPA: classifying nsSNPs to predict disease association.
PG  - 228
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0673-2 [doi]
LID - 228
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are the most 
      common DNA sequence variation associated with disease in humans. Thus determining 
      the clinical significance of each nsSNP is of great importance. Potential 
      detrimental nsSNPs may be identified by genetic association studies or by 
      functional analysis in the laboratory, both of which are expensive and time 
      consuming. Existing computational methods lack accuracy and features to 
      facilitate nsSNP classification for clinical use. We developed the GESPA (GEnomic 
      Single nucleotide Polymorphism Analyzer) program to predict the pathogenicity and 
      disease phenotype of nsSNPs. RESULTS: GESPA is a user-friendly software package 
      for classifying disease association of nsSNPs. It allows flexibility in 
      acceptable input formats and predicts the pathogenicity of a given nsSNP by 
      assessing the conservation of amino acids in orthologs and paralogs and 
      supplementing this information with data from medical literature. The development 
      and testing of GESPA was performed using the humsavar, ClinVar and humvar 
      datasets. Additionally, GESPA also predicts the disease phenotype associated with 
      a nsSNP with high accuracy, a feature unavailable in existing software. GESPA's 
      overall accuracy exceeds existing computational methods for predicting nsSNP 
      pathogenicity. The usability of GESPA is enhanced by fast SQL-based cloud storage 
      and retrieval of data. CONCLUSIONS: GESPA is a novel bioinformatics tool to 
      determine the pathogenicity and phenotypes of nsSNPs. We anticipate that GESPA 
      will become a useful clinical framework for predicting the disease association of 
      nsSNPs. The program, executable jar file, source code, GPL 3.0 license, user 
      guide, and test data with instructions are available at

TI  - Morphoscopic Trait Expression in "Hispanic" Populations.
PG  - 1135-9
LID - 10.1111/1556-4029.12826 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluates population variation of eight cranial morphoscopic traits 
      using samples of known southwest Hispanics (n=72), Guatemalans (n=106), American 
      Blacks (n=146), and American Whites (n=218). We applied the support vector 
      machine (SVM) method to build a prediction model based on a subsample (20%) of 
      the data; the remainder of the data was used as a test sample. The SVM approach 
      effectively differentiated between the four groups with correct classification 
      rates between 72% (Guatemalan group) and 94% (American Black group). However, 
      when the Guatemalan and southwest Hispanic samples were pooled, the same model 
      correctly classified all groups with a higher degree of accuracy (American 
      Black=96%; American White=77%; and the pooled Hispanic sample=91%). This study 
      also identified significant differences between the two Hispanic groups in six of 
      the eight traits using univariate statistical tests. These results speak to the 
      unique population histories of these samples and the current use of the term 
      "Hispanic" within forensic anthropology. Finally, we argue that the SVM can be 
      used as a classification model for ancestry estimation in a forensic context and 
      as a diagnostic tool may broaden the application of morphoscopic trait data for 
      the assessment of ancestry.

TI  - Wastewater surveillance provides 10-days forecasting of COVID-19 hospitalizations 
      superior to cases and test positivity: A prediction study.
PG  - 1138-1150
LID - 10.1016/j.idm.2023.10.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The public health response to COVID-19 has shifted to reducing deaths 
      and hospitalizations to prevent overwhelming health systems. The amount of 
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in wastewater are known to correlate with clinical data 
      including cases and hospital admissions for COVID-19. We developed and tested a 
      predictive model for incident COVID-19 hospital admissions in New York State 
      using wastewater data. METHODS: Using county-level COVID-19 hospital admissions 
      and wastewater surveillance covering 13.8 million people across 56 counties, we 
      fit a generalized linear mixed model predicting new hospital admissions from 
      wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from April 29, 2020 to June 30, 2022. 
      We included covariates such as COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the county, 
      comorbidities, demographic variables, and holiday gatherings. FINDINGS: 
      Wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA correlated with new hospital 
      admissions per 100,000 up to ten days prior to admission. Models that included 
      wastewater had higher predictive power than models that included clinical cases 
      only, increasing the accuracy of the model by 15%. Predicted hospital admissions 
      correlated highly with observed admissions (r = 0.77) with an average difference 
      of 0.013 hospitalizations per 100,000 (95% CI = [0.002, 0.025]). INTERPRETATION: 
      Using wastewater to predict future hospital admissions from COVID-19 is accurate 
      and effective with superior results to using case data alone. The lead time of 
      ten days could alert the public to take precautions and improve resource 
      allocation for seasonal surges.

TI  - Predicting Surgical Experience After Robotic Nerve-sparing Radical Prostatectomy 
      Simulation Using a Machine Learning-based Multimodal Analysis of Objective 
      Performance Metrics.
PG  - 447-455

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Machine learning methods have emerged as objective tools to 
      evaluate operative performance in urological procedures. Our objectives were to 
      establish machine learning-based methods for predicting surgeon caseload for 
      nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using our validated 
      hydrogel-based simulation platform and identify potential metrics of surgical 
      expertise. METHODS: Video, robotic kinematics, and force sensor data were 
      collected from 35 board-certified urologists at the 2022 AUA conference. Video 
      was annotated for surgical gestures. Objective performance indicators were 
      derived from robotic system kinematic data. Force metrics were calculated from 
      hydrogel model integrated sensors. Data were fitted to 3 supervised machine 
      learning models-logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest 
      neighbors-which were used to predict procedure-specific learning curve 
      proficiency. Recursive feature elimination was used to optimize the best 
      performing model. RESULTS: Logistic regression predicted caseload with the 
      highest AUC score for 5/7 possible data combinations (force, 64%; objective 
      performance indicators + gestures, 94%; objective performance indicators + force, 
      90%; gestures + force, 93%; objective performance indicators + gestures + force, 
      94%). Support vector machine predicted the highest AUC score for objective 
      performance indicators (82%) and gestures (94%). Logistic regression with 
      recursive feature elimination was the most effective model reaching 96% AUC in 
      predicting case-specific experience. Most contributory features were identified 
      across all model types. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a machine learning-based 
      algorithm utilizing a novel combination of objective performance indicators, 
      gesture analysis, and integrated force metrics to predict surgical experience, 
      capable of discriminating between surgeons with low or high robot-assisted 
      radical prostatectomy caseload with 96% AUC in a standardized, simulation-based 
      environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous small study suggested that Brain Network Activation (BNA), 
      a novel ERP-based brain network analysis, may have diagnostic utility in 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we examined the 
      diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a 
      larger population of adults with and without ADHD. METHOD: Subjects were 
      unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without 
      a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a 
      response inhibition task (Go/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain 
      Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a 
      display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing 
      information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed 
      into a machine learning algorithm. RESULTS: The BNA analysis of the EEG data 
      recorded during the Go/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity 
      between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 
      0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for 
      the NoGo condition). CONCLUSIONS: BNA methodology can help differentiate between 
      ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data 
      support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective 
      evaluation of electrophysiological changes associated with ADHD. Results also 
      support a network-based approach to the study of ADHD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic components play important roles in the susceptibility to 
      major depressive disorder (MDD). The rapid development of sequencing technologies 
      is allowing scientists to contribute new ideas for personalized medicine; thus, 
      it is essential to design non-invasive genetic tests on sequencing data, which 
      can help physicians diagnose and differentiate depressed patients and healthy 
      individuals. METHODS: We have recently proposed a genetic concept involving 
      single-nucleotide variant proportion (SNVP) in genes to study MDD. Using this 
      approach, we investigated combinations of distance metrics and hierarchical 
      clustering criteria for genetic clustering of depressed patients and ethnically 
      matched controls. RESULTS: We analysed clustering results of 25 human subjects 
      based on their SNVPs in 46 newly discovered candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      According to our findings, we recommend Canberra metric with Ward's method to be 
      used in hierarchical clustering of depressed and normal individuals. Futures 
      studies are needed to advance this line of research validating our approach in 
      larger datasets, those may also be allow the investigation of MDD subtypes. 
      LIMITATIONS: High quality sequencing costs limited our ability to obtain larger 
      datasets.

AB  - Variations in anxiety-related behavior are associated with individual allostatic 
      set-points in chronically stressed rats. Actively offensive rats with the 
      externalizing indicators of sniffling and climbing the stimulus and material 
      tearing during 10 days of predator scent stress had reduced plasma 
      corticosterone, increased striatal glutamate metabolites, and increased adrenal 
      11-dehydrocorticosterone content compared to passively defensive rats with the 
      internalizing indicators of freezing and grooming, as well as to controls without 
      any behavioral changes. These findings suggest that rats that display active 
      offensive activity in response to stress develop anxiety associated with 
      decreased allostatic set-points and increased resistance to stress.

TI  - Creating Accessible Survey Instruments for Use with Autistic Adults and People 
      with Intellectual Disability: Lessons Learned and Recommendations.
PG  - 61-76
LID - 10.1089/aut.2019.0074 [doi]
AB  - Despite growing appreciation of the need for research on autism in adulthood, few 
      survey instruments have been validated for use with autistic adults. We conducted 
      an institutional ethnography of two related partnerships that used participatory 
      approaches to conduct research in collaboration with autistic people and people 
      with intellectual disability. In this article, we focus on lessons learned from 
      adapting survey instruments for use in six separate studies. Community partners 
      identified several common problems that made original instruments inaccessible. 
      Examples included: (1) the use of difficult vocabulary, confusing terms, or 
      figures of speech; (2) complex sentence structure, confusing grammar, or 
      incomplete phrases; (3) imprecise response options; (4) variation in item 
      response based on different contexts; (5) anxiety related to not being able to 
      answer with full accuracy; (6) lack of items to fully capture the autism-specific 
      aspects of a construct; and (7) ableist language or concepts. Common adaptations 
      included: (1) adding prefaces to increase precision or explain context; (2) 
      modifying items to simplify sentence structure; (3) substituting difficult 
      vocabulary words, confusing terms, or figures of speech with more straightforward 
      terms; (4) adding hotlinks that define problematic terms or offer examples or 
      clarifications; (5) adding graphics to increase clarity of response options; and 
      (6) adding new items related to autism-specific aspects of the construct. We 
      caution against using instruments developed for other populations unless 
      instruments are carefully tested with autistic adults, and we describe one 
      possible approach to ensure that instruments are accessible to a wide range of 
      autistic participants. LAY SUMMARY: Why is this topic important?: To understand 
      what can improve the lives of autistic adults, researchers need to collect survey 
      data directly from autistic adults. However, most survey instruments were made 
      for the general population and may or may not work well for autistic adults.What 
      is the purpose of this article?: To use lessons learned from our experience 
      adapting surveys-in partnership with autistic adults-to create a set of 
      recommendations for how researchers may adapt instruments to be accessible to 
      autistic adults.What did the authors do?: Between 2006 and 2019, the Academic 
      Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) and the 
      Partnering with People with Developmental Disabilities to Address Violence 
      Consortium used a participatory research approach to adapt many survey 
      instruments for use in six separate studies. We reviewed records from these 
      partnerships and identified important lessons.What is this recommended adaptation 
      process like?: The adaptation process includes the following:  (1) Co-creating 
      collaboration guidelines and providing community partners with necessary 
      background about terminology and processes used in survey 
      research; (2) Collaboratively selecting which constructs to 
      measure; (3) Discussing each construct so that we can have a shared understanding 
      of what it means; (4) Identifying existing instruments for each 
      construct; (5) Selecting among available instruments (or deciding that none are 
      acceptable and that we need to create a new measure); (6) Assessing the necessary 
      adaptations for each instrument; (7) Collaboratively modifying prefaces, items, 
      or response options, as needed; (8) Adding "hotlink" definitions where necessary 
      to clarify or provide examples of terms and constructs; (9) Creating new 
      measures, when needed, in partnership with autistic adults;(10)Considering the 
      appropriateness of creating proxy report versions of each adapted measure; 
      and(11)Assessing the adapted instruments' psychometric properties.What were 
      common concerns about existing instruments?: Partners often said that, if taking 
      a survey that used the original instruments, they would experience confusion, 
      frustration, anxiety, or anger. They repeatedly stated that, faced with such 
      measures, they would offer unreliable answers, leave items blank, or just stop 
      participating in the study. Common concerns included the use of difficult 
      vocabulary, confusing terms, complex sentence structure, convoluted phrasings, 
      figures of speech, or imprecise language. Partners struggled with response 
      options that used vague terms. They also felt anxious if their answer might not 
      be completely accurate or if their responses could vary in different situations. 
      Often the surveys did not completely capture the intended idea. Sometimes, 
      instruments used offensive language or ideas. And in some cases, there just were 
      not any instruments to measure what they thought was important.What were common 
      adaptations?: Common adaptations included: (1) adding prefaces to increase 
      precision or explain context; (2) modifying items to simplify sentence structure; 
      (3) substituting difficult vocabulary words, confusing terms, or figures of 
      speech with more straightforward terms; (4) adding hotlinks that define 
      problematic terms or offer examples or clarifications; (5) adding graphics to 
      increase clarity of response options; and (6) adding new items related to 
      autism-specific aspects of the construct.How will this article help autistic 
      adults now or in the future?: We hope that this article encourages researchers to 
      collaborate with autistic adults to create better survey instruments. That way, 
      when researchers evaluate interventions and services, they can have the right 
      tools to see if they are effective.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that can predict which emergency department (ED) 
      patients with mTBI are likely to develop persistent post-concussion symptoms 
      (PPCS). DESIGN: A matched case-control study was conducted at a Level 1 trauma 
      centre between June 2006 and July 2009. Patients diagnosed with mTBI in the ED 
      and diagnosed at a concussion management programme with at least one PPCS (85 
      cases) were compared to patients diagnosed with mTBI in the ED (340 controls) to 
      determine if factors assessed at the time of ED presentation could predict 
      patients likely to develop persistent symptoms. RESULTS: Multivariable 
      hierarchical logistic regression with variables indicating increased risk for 
      PPCS (prior mTBI, history of depression, history of anxiety, multiple injury, 
      forgetfulness/poor memory, noise sensitivity, or light sensitivity) resulted in a 
      final predictive model including prior mTBI, history of anxiety, 
      forgetfulness/poor memory and light sensitivity. The final model had a 
      specificity of 87.9% and a sensitivity of 69.9%. CONCLUSIONS: A strong prediction 
      model to identify those ED patients with mTBI at risk for PPCS was developed and 
      could be easily implemented in the ED; therefore, helping to target those 
      patients who would potentially benefit from close follow-up.

TI  - Development of informant-report neurobehavioral survey scales for PTEN hamartoma 
      tumor syndrome and related neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes.
PG  - 1741-1757
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.63195 [doi]
AB  - There are few well-validated measures that are appropriate for assessing the full 
      range of neurobehavioral presentations in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) 
      and other neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes (NDGS). As potential therapeutics 
      are developed, having reliable, valid, free, and easily accessible measures to 
      track a range of neurobehavioral domains will be crucial for future clinical 
      trials. This study focused on the development and initial psychometric evaluation 
      of a set of freely available informant-report survey scales for PHTS-the 
      Neurobehavioral Evaluation Tool (NET). Concept elicitation, quantitative ratings, 
      and cognitive interviewing processes were conducted with stakeholders and 
      clinician-scientist experts, used to identify the most important neurobehavioral 
      domains for this population, and to ensure items were appropriate for the full 
      range of individuals with PHTS. Results of this process identified a PHTS 
      neurobehavioral impact model with 11 domains. The final NET scales assessing 
      these domains were administered to a sample of 384 participants (median 
      completion time = 20.6 min), including 32 people with PHTS, 141 with other NDGS, 
      47 with idiopathic neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), and 164 neurotypical 
      controls. Initial psychometric results for the total scores of each scale 
      indicated very good model (ω = 0.83-0.99) and internal consistency reliability 
      (α = 0.82-0.98) as well as excellent test-retest reproducibility at 1-month 
      follow-up (r = 0.78-0.98) and stability at 4-month follow-up (r = 0.76-0.96). 
      Conditional reliability estimates indicated very strong measurement precision in 
      key score ranges for assessing PHTS and other people with NDGS and/or idiopathic 
      NDD. Comparisons across domains between PHTS and the other groups revealed 
      specific patterns of symptoms and functioning, including lower levels of 
      challenging behavior and more developed daily living and executive functioning 
      skills relative to other NDGS. The NET appears to be a reliable and potentially 
      useful tool for clinical characterization and monitoring of neurobehavioral 
      symptoms in PHTS and may also have utility in the assessment of other NDGS and 
      idiopathic NDD. Additional validation work, including convergent and discriminant 
      validity analyses, are needed to replicate and extend these observations.

TI  - A Genetics-First Approach to Dissecting the Heterogeneity of Autism: Phenotypic 
      Comparison of Autism Risk Copy Number Variants.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20010015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Certain copy number variants (CNVs) greatly increase the risk of 
      autism. The authors conducted a genetics-first study to investigate whether 
      heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of autism is underpinned by specific 
      genotype-phenotype relationships. METHODS: This international study included 547 
      individuals (mean age, 12.3 years [SD=4.2], 54% male) who were ascertained on the 
      basis of having a genetic diagnosis of a rare CNV associated with high risk of 
      autism (82 16p11.2 deletion carriers, 50 16p11.2 duplication carriers, 370 
      22q11.2 deletion carriers, and 45 22q11.2 duplication carriers), as well as 2,027 
      individuals (mean age, 9.1 years [SD=4.9], 86% male) with autism of heterogeneous 
      etiology. Assessments included the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and IQ 
      testing. RESULTS: The four genetic variant groups differed in autism symptom 
      severity, autism subdomain profile, and IQ profile. However, substantial 
      variability was observed in phenotypic outcome in individual genetic variant 
      groups (74%-97% of the variance, depending on the trait), whereas variability 
      between groups was low (1%-21%, depending on the trait). CNV carriers who met 
      autism criteria were compared with individuals with heterogeneous autism, and a 
      range of profile differences were identified. When clinical cutoff scores were 
      applied, 54% of individuals with one of the four CNVs who did not meet full 
      autism diagnostic criteria had elevated levels of autistic traits. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Many CNV carriers do not meet full diagnostic criteria for autism but 
      nevertheless meet clinical cutoffs for autistic traits. Although profile 
      differences between variants were observed, there is considerable variability in 
      clinical symptoms in the same variant.

AB  - In vivo experimental analysis of human brain tissue poses substantial challenges 
      and ethical concerns. To address this problem, we developed a computational 
      method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network-Imputation Engine 
      (BrainGENIE) that leverages peripheral-blood transcriptomes to predict brain 
      tissue-specific gene-expression levels. Paired blood-brain transcriptomic data 
      collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project was used to train 
      BrainGENIE models to predict gene-expression levels in ten distinct brain regions 
      using whole-blood gene-expression profiles. The performance of BrainGENIE was 
      compared to PrediXcan, a popular method for imputing gene expression levels from 
      genotypes. BrainGENIE significantly predicted brain tissue-specific expression 
      levels for 2947-11,816 genes (false-discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05), including 
      many transcripts that cannot be predicted significantly by a 
      transcriptome-imputation method such as PrediXcan. BrainGENIE recapitulated 
      measured diagnosis-related gene-expression changes in the brain for autism, 
      bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia better than direct correlations from blood 
      and predictions from PrediXcan. We developed a convenient software toolset for 
      deploying BrainGENIE, and provide recommendations for how best to implement 
      models. BrainGENIE complements and, in some ways, outperforms existing 
      transcriptome-imputation tools, providing biologically meaningful predictions and 
      opening new research avenues.

TI  - Feasibility Assessment of Patient Reporting of Symptomatic Adverse Events in 
      Multicenter Cancer Clinical Trials.
PG  - 1043-1050
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.6749 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: In cancer clinical trials, symptomatic adverse events (AEs), such as 
      nausea, are reported by investigators rather than by patients. There is 
      increasing interest to collect symptomatic AE data via patient-reported outcome 
      (PRO) questionnaires, but it is unclear whether it is feasible to implement this 
      approach in multicenter trials. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients are 
      willing and able to report their symptomatic AEs in multicenter trials. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 361 consecutive patients enrolled in any 1 
      of 9 US multicenter cancer treatment trials were invited to self-report 13 common 
      symptomatic AEs using a PRO adaptation of the National Cancer Institute's Common 
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) via tablet computers at 5 
      successive clinic visits. Patient adherence was tracked with reasons for missed 
      self-reports. Agreement with clinician AE reports was analyzed with weighted κ 
      statistics. Patient and investigator perspectives were elicited by survey. The 
      study was conducted from March 15, 2007, to August 11, 2011. Data analysis was 
      performed from August 9, 2013, to March 21, 2014. RESULTS: Of the 361 patients 
      invited to participate, 285 individuals enrolled, with a median age of 57 years 
      (range, 24-88), 202 (74.3%) female, 241 (85.5%) white, 73 (26.8%) with a high 
      school education or less, and 176 (64.7%) who reported regular internet use 
      (denominators varied owing to missing data). Across all patients and trials, 
      there were 1280 visits during which patients had an opportunity to self-report 
      (ie, patients were alive and enrolled in a treatment trial at the time of the 
      visit). Self-reports were completed at 1202 visits (93.9% overall adherence). 
      Adherence was highest at baseline and declined over time (visit 1, 100%; visit 2, 
      96%; visit 3, 95%; visit 4, 91%; and visit 5, 85%). Reasons for missing PROs 
      included institutional errors in 27 of 48 (56.3%) of the cases (eg, staff 
      forgetting to bring computers to patients at visits), patients feeling "too ill" 
      in 8 (16.7%), patient refusal in 8 (16.7%), and internet connectivity problems in 
      5 (10.4%). Patient-investigator CTCAE agreement was moderate or worse for most 
      symptoms (most κ < 0.05), with investigators reporting fewer AEs than patients 
      across symptoms. Most patients believed that the system was easy to use (234 
      [93.2%]) and useful (230 [93.1%]), and investigators thought that the 
      patient-reported AEs were useful (133 [94.3%]) and accurate (119 [83.2%]). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Participants in multicenter cancer trials are willing 
      and able to report their own symptomatic AEs at most clinic visits and report 
      more AEs than investigators. This approach may improve the precision of AE 
      reporting in cancer trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objectives of this study were to describe 
      robot-assisted sialolithotomy with sialendoscopy (RASS) for the management of 
      large palpable hilar submandibular gland (SMG) stones and analyze procedural 
      success and lingual nerve damage following RASS in comparison to the combined 
      transoral sialendoscopic approach. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. 
      METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with large 
      palpable hilar SMG stones managed with RASS following institutional review board 
      approval. Large stones were defined as ≥5 mm, the upper limit that can be removed 
      via sialendoscopy. Twenty-two patients between January 2012 and June 2014, with 
      mean stone size of 12.3 mm, were identified. Data collected included symptoms of 
      recurrence, postoperative lingual nerve function, and patient satisfaction at a 
      mean follow-up of 14 months. Procedural success was defined as absence of symptom 
      recurrence in conjunction with gland preservation. These measures were compared 
      with the combined approach (CA) outcomes reported in the English literature. 
      RESULTS: Procedural success was 100% (22/22) for our cohort. No patients reported 
      symptoms of lingual nerve damage at follow-up, whereas four patients reported 
      transient lingual nerve paresthesia (mean duration, 2.5 weeks). Mean patient 
      satisfaction was 9.9 out of 10. Literature review identified 135 patients in the 
      CA cohort. Procedural success rate for these patients was 75%, and lingual nerve 
      damage was reported in 2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the 
      safety and efficacy of RASS in the management of large SMG sialoliths. We 
      attribute this preliminary success of RASS to the enhanced visualization, 
      magnification, and technical advantages of the procedure. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

LID - 322
AB  - The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be a powerful tool for a 
      variety of physics topics. The high-intensity proton beams provide a large 
      neutrino flux, sampled by a near detector system consisting of a combination of 
      capable precision detectors, and by the massive far detector system located deep 
      underground. This configuration sets up DUNE as a machine for discovery, as it 
      enables opportunities not only to perform precision neutrino measurements that 
      may uncover deviations from the present three-flavor mixing paradigm, but also to 
      discover new particles and unveil new interactions and symmetries beyond those 
      predicted in the Standard Model (SM). Of the many potential beyond the Standard 
      Model (BSM) topics DUNE will probe, this paper presents a selection of studies 
      quantifying DUNE's sensitivities to sterile neutrino mixing, heavy neutral 
      leptons, non-standard interactions, CPT symmetry violation, Lorentz invariance 
      violation, neutrino trident production, dark matter from both beam induced and 
      cosmogenic sources, baryon number violation, and other new physics topics that 
      complement those at high-energy colliders and significantly extend the present 
      reach.

TI  - Nature of collective decision-making by simple yes/no decision units.
PG  - 14436
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-14626-z [doi]
LID - 14436
AB  - The study of collective decision-making spans various fields such as brain and 
      behavioural sciences, economics, management sciences, and artificial 
      intelligence. Despite these interdisciplinary applications, little is known 
      regarding how a group of simple 'yes/no' units, such as neurons in the brain, can 
      select the best option among multiple options. One prerequisite for achieving 
      such correct choices by the brain is correct evaluation of relative option 
      quality, which enables a collective decision maker to efficiently choose the best 
      option. Here, we applied a sensory discrimination mechanism using yes/no units 
      with differential thresholds to a model for making a collective choice among 
      multiple options. The performance corresponding to the correct choice was shown 
      to be affected by various parameters. High performance can be achieved by tuning 
      the threshold distribution with the options' quality distribution. The number of 
      yes/no units allocated to each option and its variability profoundly affects 
      performance. When this variability is large, a quorum decision becomes superior 
      to a majority decision under some conditions. The general features of this 
      collective decision-making by a group of simple yes/no units revealed in this 
      study suggest that this mechanism may be useful in applications across various 
      fields.

TI  - Perturbed Microbial Ecology in Myasthenia Gravis: Evidence from the Gut 
      Microbiome and Fecal Metabolome.

LID - 1901441
AB  - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a devastating acquired autoimmune disease. Emerging 
      evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a key role in maintaining immune 
      system homeostasis. This work reports that MG is characterized by decreased 
      α-phylogenetic diversity, and significantly disturbed gut microbiome and fecal 
      metabolome. The altered gut microbial composition is associated with fecal 
      metabolome changes, with 38.75% of altered bacterial operational taxonomic units 
      showing significant correlations with a range of metabolite biomarkers. Some 
      microbes are particularly linked with MG severity. Moreover, a combination of 
      microbial makers and their correlated metabolites enable discriminating MG from 
      healthy controls (HCs) with 100% accuracy. To investigate whether disturbed gut 
      mcirobiome might contribute to the onset of MG, germ-free (GF) mice are initially 
      colonized with MG microbiota (MMb) or healthy microbiota (HMb), and then 
      immunized in a classic mouse model of MG. The MMb mice demonstrate substantially 
      impaired locomotion ability compared with the HMb mice. This effect could be 
      reversed by cocolonizing GF mice with both MMb and HMb. The MMb mice also exhibit 
      similar disturbances of fecal metabolic pathways as found in MG. Together these 
      data demonstrate disturbances in microbiome composition and activity that are 
      likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of MG.

TI  - Testing differential susceptibility: Plasticity genes, the social environment, 
      and their interplay in adolescent response inhibition.
PG  - 308-321
LID - 10.3109/15622975.2016.1173724 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Impaired inhibitory control is a key feature of 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We investigated gene-environment 
      interaction (GxE) as a possible contributing factor to response inhibition 
      variation in context of the differential susceptibility theory. This states 
      individuals carrying plasticity gene variants will be more disadvantaged in 
      negative, but more advantaged in positive environments. METHODS: Behavioural and 
      neural measures of response inhibition were assessed during a Stop-signal task in 
      participants with (N = 197) and without (N = 295) ADHD, from N = 278 families 
      (age M = 17.18, SD =3.65). We examined GxE between candidate plasticity genes 
      (DAT1, 5-HTT, DRD4) and social environments (maternal expressed emotion, peer 
      affiliation). RESULTS: A DRD4 × Positive peer affiliation interaction was found 
      on the right fusiform gyrus (rFG) activation during successful inhibition. 
      Further, 5-HTT short allele carriers showed increased rFG activation during 
      failed inhibitions. Maternal warmth and positive peer affiliation were positively 
      associated with right inferior frontal cortex activation during successful 
      inhibition. Deviant peer affiliation was positively related to the error rate. 
      CONCLUSIONS: While a pattern of differential genetic susceptibility was found, 
      more clarity on the role of the FG during response inhibition is warranted before 
      firm conclusions can be made. Positive and negative social environments were 
      related to inhibitory control. This extends previous research emphasizing adverse 
      environments.

LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0430 [doi]
AB  - Primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (PMNSGCT) frequently become 
      refractory to chemotherapy, and no effective salvage therapy exists. We performed 
      genomic profiling on a series of 44 PMNSGCT and compared the results with those 
      from chemorefractory, metastatic pure seminomatous (Sem, n = 22) and 
      nonseminomatous (NS, n = 86) testicular germ cell tumors. Archival tissues were 
      sequenced by a hybrid capture-based technology (FoundationONE; Foundation 
      Medicine, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor 
      mutational burden (TMB, mutations [mut]/Mb) were determined.Statistically 
      significant differences in genomic alterations (GA) of PMNSGCT versus NS included 
      higher TP53 pathway GA (p < .0001), PIK3CA pathway GA (p < .0001), and lower 
      cell-cycle pathway GA (p = .0004). There were no MSI-high PMNSGCT cases. Mean TMB 
      was similar between the groups, but there were more ≥10 mut/Mb in the PMNSGCT 
      group versus NS (11.4% vs. 4.6%).The GA identified in PMNSGCT were similar to the 
      findings from NS, with differential opportunities for targeted therapies and 
      immunotherapies. Further study of precision treatments appears warranted.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of rare copy number variations reveals PARK2 as a candidate 
      gene for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.1038/mp.2012.161 [doi]
AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, highly heritable 
      neurodevelopmental disorder. Genetic loci have not yet been identified by 
      genome-wide association studies. Rare copy number variations (CNVs), such as 
      chromosomal deletions or duplications, have been implicated in ADHD and other 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. To identify rare (frequency ≤1%) CNVs that increase 
      the risk of ADHD, we performed a whole-genome CNV analysis based on 489 young 
      ADHD patients and 1285 adult population-based controls and identified one 
      significantly associated CNV region. In tests for a global burden of large 
      (>500 kb) rare CNVs, we observed a nonsignificant (P=0.271) 1.126-fold enriched 
      rate of subjects carrying at least one such CNV in the group of ADHD cases. 
      Locus-specific tests of association were used to assess if there were more rare 
      CNVs in cases compared with controls. Detected CNVs, which were significantly 
      enriched in the ADHD group, were validated by quantitative (q)PCR. Findings were 
      replicated in an independent sample of 386 young patients with ADHD and 781 young 
      population-based healthy controls. We identified rare CNVs within the parkinson 
      protein 2 gene (PARK2) with a significantly higher prevalence in ADHD patients 
      than in controls (P=2.8 × 10(-4) after empirical correction for genome-wide 
      testing). In total, the PARK2 locus (chr 6: 162 659 756-162 767 019) harboured 
      three deletions and nine duplications in the ADHD patients and two deletions and 
      two duplications in the controls. By qPCR analysis, we validated 11 of the 12 
      CNVs in ADHD patients (P=1.2 × 10(-3) after empirical correction for genome-wide 
      testing). In the replication sample, CNVs at the PARK2 locus were found in four 
      additional ADHD patients and one additional control (P=4.3 × 10(-2)). Our results 
      suggest that copy number variants at the PARK2 locus contribute to the genetic 
      susceptibility of ADHD. Mutations and CNVs in PARK2 are known to be associated 
      with Parkinson disease.

TI  - Advanced Paternal Age and Early Onset of Schizophrenia in Sporadic Cases: Not 
      Confounded by Parental Polygenic Risk for Schizophrenia.
PG  - 56-64
LID - S0006-3223(19)30069-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.01.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether paternal age effect on schizophrenia is a causation or just 
      an association due to confounding by selection into late parenthood is still 
      debated. We investigated the association between paternal age and early onset of 
      schizophrenia in offspring, controlling for both paternal and maternal 
      predisposition to schizophrenia as empirically estimated using polygenic risk 
      score (PRS) derived from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. METHODS: Among 2923 
      sporadic schizophrenia cases selected from the Schizophrenia Trio Genomic 
      Research in Taiwan project, 1649 had parents' genotyping data. The relationships 
      of paternal schizophrenia PRS to paternal age at first birth (AFB) and of 
      maternal schizophrenia PRS to maternal AFB were examined. A logistic regression 
      model of patients' early onset of schizophrenia (≤18 years old) on paternal age 
      was conducted. RESULTS: Advanced paternal age over 20 years exhibited a trend of 
      an increasing proportion of early onset of schizophrenia (odds ratio per 10-year 
      increase in paternal age = 1.28, p = .007) after adjusting for maternal age, sex, 
      and age. Older paternal AFB also exhibited an increasing trend of paternal 
      schizophrenia PRS. Additionally, a U-shaped relationship between maternal AFB and 
      maternal schizophrenia PRS was observed. After adjusting for both paternal and 
      maternal schizophrenia PRS, the association of paternal age with patients' early 
      onset of schizophrenia remained (odds ratio = 1.29, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      association between paternal age and early onset of schizophrenia was not 
      confounded by parental PRS for schizophrenia, which partially captures parental 
      genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. Our findings support an independent role 
      of paternal age per se in increased risk of early onset of schizophrenia in 
      offspring.

AB  - There is a crisis in mental health care, with more people suffering from 
      psychiatric disorders than resources that are available for treatment, even 
      though spending is substantial. Millions who suffer from addiction, psychosis, 
      depression and suicidality are either untreated or inadequately treated and 
      organized psychiatry is unable to reach them. Possibly as reflection of 
      under-treatment of psychiatric disorders, the rates of suicide have risen: from 
      1999 through 2014, the age-adjusted suicide rate in the US increased 24%, from 
      10.5 to 13.0 per 100,000. Assessment of psychiatric symptoms in ongoing 
      outpatient settings is costly, inadequate and unable to detect clinical changes 
      over time. One's digital phenotype is assessed through footprints left over as 
      result of our interface with technology, including automated assessments of 
      quantity and quality of social media activity, patterns and speed of device 
      usage, and physiological data that is automatically collected, such as location, 
      quantity and type of movement, heart rate, and sleep patterns. The use of digital 
      footprints has been advocated for large-scale data collection that can facilitate 
      psychiatric research in naturalistic settings. We highlight recent papers in 
      Discover Mental Health addressing digital approaches to mental health and we also 
      advance here the concept that digital footprints are ready for clinical use. 
      However, before that happens there needs to be discussion on the appropriate 
      boundaries between care that is driven by signals from digital footprints and the 
      rights to privacy and self-determination.

TI  - Comprehensive Landscape of Cyclin Pathway Gene Alterations and Co-occurrence with 
      FGF/FGFR Aberrations Across Urinary Tract Tumors.
PG  - e82-e91
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac180 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclin pathway gene alterations are frequent in urothelial tumors and 
      may co-exist with other important aberrations, leading to therapeutic 
      opportunities. We characterized the landscape of cyclin gene alterations in 
      urothelial and non-urothelial urinary tract (UT) malignancies. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Overall, 6842 urothelial and 897 non-urothelial UT cancers were analyzed 
      (hybrid-capture-based comprehensive genomic profile (Foundation Medicine)). 
      Alteration frequency in cyclin-sensitizing and -resistance genes, and 
      co-occurrence with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene abnormalities 
      were evaluated. RESULTS: Cyclin-activating gene alterations were detected in 
      47.3% of urothelial and 37.9% of non-urothelial UT cancers. Frequency varied by 
      histology and tumor site. CDKN2A and CDKN2B loss were the most frequent 
      alterations in urothelial tumors (present in 38.5% and 30.4% of patients, 
      respectively). Both genes were less frequently altered in adenocarcinomas (15.2% 
      and 8.9%), but commonly altered in squamous cell carcinomas (74.4% and 39%). 
      Tumors of neuroendocrine origin were relatively silent in activating cyclin 
      alterations, but frequently displayed Rb1 alterations (86% and 83.7% of 
      neuroendocrines and small cell carcinomas). Urachal tumors (n = 79) presented a 
      distinct landscape of cyclin alterations relative to other UT cancers, with less 
      frequent alterations overall. FGF/FGFR genes were altered in 34.9% of urothelial 
      (22.1% in FGFR3), and 19.4% of non-urothelial urinary tract tumors (6.8% FGFR3). 
      Cyclin-activating alterations frequently co-occurred with FGF/FGFR alterations 
      but were in general mutually exclusively with cyclin resistance alterations 
      (RB1/CCNE1). CONCLUSIONS: Cyclin pathway activating alterations are common in 
      urinary tract tumors, but frequency varies with histology and tumors sites. 
      Co-occurrence of cyclin and FGFR pathway alterations may inform therapeutic 
      opportunities.

TI  - Genomic analysis of the natural history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder using Neanderthal and ancient Homo sapiens samples.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an impairing 
      neurodevelopmental condition highly prevalent in current populations. Several 
      hypotheses have been proposed to explain this paradox, mainly in the context of 
      the Paleolithic versus Neolithic cultural shift but especially within the 
      framework of the mismatch theory. This theory elaborates on how a particular 
      trait once favoured in an ancient environment might become maladaptive upon 
      environmental changes. However, given the lack of genomic data available for 
      ADHD, these theories have not been empirically tested. We took advantage of the 
      largest GWAS meta-analysis available for this disorder consisting of over 20,000 
      individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 35,000 controls, to assess the evolution of 
      ADHD-associated alleles in European populations using archaic, ancient and modern 
      human samples. We also included Approximate Bayesian computation coupled with 
      deep learning analyses and singleton density scores to detect human adaptation. 
      Our analyses indicate that ADHD-associated alleles are enriched in loss of 
      function intolerant genes, supporting the role of selective pressures in this 
      early-onset phenotype. Furthermore, we observed that the frequency of variants 
      associated with ADHD has steadily decreased since Paleolithic times, particularly 
      in Paleolithic European populations compared to samples from the Neolithic 
      Fertile Crescent. We demonstrate this trend cannot be explained by African 
      admixture nor Neanderthal introgression, since introgressed Neanderthal alleles 
      are enriched in ADHD risk variants. All analyses performed support the presence 
      of long-standing selective pressures acting against ADHD-associated alleles until 
      recent times. Overall, our results are compatible with the mismatch theory for 
      ADHD but suggest a much older time frame for the evolution of ADHD-associated 
      alleles compared to previous hypotheses.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of the Thermo fisher TaqPath™ COVID-19 combo kit with the 
      Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal 
      specimens.

AB  - PURPOSE: With over 50 SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification assays that have been EUA 
      cleared with minimal experimental validation performed, it is likely that not all 
      of these assays are comparable in their ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical 
      specimens. Thermo Fisher Scientific is a relatively new company in the molecular 
      diagnostics field and the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of 
      the Thermo Fisher TaqPath™ Combo Kit with an established test, the Cepheid Xpert® 
      Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, for its ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal 
      specimens. METHODS: A total of 300 randomly selected nasopharyngeal specimens 
      were evaluated and tested by the TaqPath and GeneXpert assays. Discordant test 
      specimens were arbitrated by performing an alternative PCR assay and Sanger 
      sequencing. RESULTS: The TaqPath assay had a 96.7 and 99.6% positive and negative 
      agreement respectively when compared to the Xpert Xpress test. However, after 
      test arbitration, the three discordant specimens were arbitrated in favor of the 
      TaqPath assay producing a positive and negative percent agreement of 100% for the 
      TaqPath Combo Kit while the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay had a positive and negative 
      percent agreement of 98.3 and 99.2% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TaqPath Combo 
      Kit is a high complexity assay that compares favorably with the Xpert Xpress test 
      and can be reliably used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal 
      specimens.

AB  - The authors present a cohort of 661 young adult glioblastomas diagnosed using 
      2016 WHO World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central 
      Nervous System, utilizing comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to explore their 
      genomic landscape and assess their relationship to currently defined disease 
      entities. This analysis explored variants with evidence of pathogenic function, 
      common copy number variants (CNVs), and several novel fusion events not described 
      in literature. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) mutational signatures, anatomic 
      location, and tumor recurrence are further explored. Using data collected from 
      CGP, unsupervised machine-learning techniques were leveraged to identify 10 
      genomic classes in previously assigned young adult glioblastomas. The authors 
      relate these molecular classes to current World Health Organization guidelines 
      and reference current literature to give therapeutic and prognostic descriptions 
      where possible.

TI  - Application of a deep learning system to detect papilledema on nonmydriatic 
      ocular fundus photographs in an emergency department.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Fundus photography vs. Ophthalmoscopy Trial Outcomes in the 
      Emergency Department (FOTO-ED) studies showed that ED providers poorly recognized 
      funduscopic findings in ED patients. We tested a modified version of the Brain 
      and Optic Nerve Study Artificial Intelligence (BONSAI) deep learning system on 
      nonmydriatic fundus photographs from the FOTO-ED studies to determine if the DLS 
      could have improved the detection of papilledema had it been available to ED 
      providers as a real-time diagnostic aid. DESIGN: Retrospective secondary analysis 
      of a cohort of patients included in the FOTO-ED studies. METHODS: The testing 
      dataset included 1608 photographs obtained in 828 patients from the FOTO-ED 
      studies. Photographs were reclassified according to the optic disc classification 
      system used by the deep learning system ["normal optic discs"; "papilledema"; 
      "other optic disc abnormalities"]. The system's performance was evaluated by 
      calculating the AUC, sensitivity and specificity using a one-vs-rest strategy, 
      with reference to expert neuro-ophthalmologists. RESULTS: The BONSAI-deep 
      learning system successfully distinguished normal from abnormal optic discs [(AUC 
      0.92 (95%CI, 0.90-0.93); sensitivity 75.6% (73.7%-77.5%) and specificity 89.6% 
      (86.3%-92.8%)], and papilledema from normal and others [(AUC 0.97 (0.95-0.99); 
      sensitivity 84.0% (75.0%-92.6%) and specificity 98.9% (98.5%-99.4%)]. Six 
      patients with missed papilledema in one eye were correctly identified by the deep 
      learning system as having papilledema in the other eye. CONCLUSIONS: The BONSAI 
      deep learning system was able to reliably identify papilledema and normal optic 
      discs on non-mydriatic photographs obtained in the FOTO-ED studies. Our deep 
      learning system has excellent potential as a diagnostic aid in EDs and 
      non-ophthalmology clinics equipped with nonmydriatic fundus cameras.

AB  - Lacrimal gland neoplasms comprise up to 18% of all orbital masses clinically and 
      histologically. Much of our current core knowledge regarding lacrimal gland 
      tumors stems from prior study of their more common counterparts, the salivary 
      glands. The prognosis for each lacrimal gland tumor is contingent upon proper 
      clinical evaluation and ultimately the histopathologic diagnosis. We describe a 
      case of an invasive carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma (Ca-ex-PA) with a 
      cystadenocarcinoma component arising from the lacrimal gland in the absence of 
      any previously diagnosed pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor) or prior 
      incisional surgery. This case illustrates the importance of the histopathologic 
      assessment including immunohistochemistry and genetic testing to narrow a 
      differential diagnosis and potentially aid or guide therapy in the future. Our 
      finding suggests that carcinoma of the lacrimal gland may be derived from 
      previously undiagnosed and perhaps even subclinical pleomorphic adenoma.

TI  - Expanded molecular detection of MPL codon p.W515 and p.S505N mutations in 
      myeloproliferative neoplasms.
PG  - e24992

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients negative for the JAK2 p.V617F somatic variant are frequently 
      reflexed to testing for MPL exon 10 variants. Detection of these variants via 
      multiplexed allele-specific PCR followed by fragment analysis has been previously 
      published. The present study builds on this concept by improving the detection of 
      the p.W515A variant, adding a second allele-specific primer to detect the p.W515R 
      variant, and incorporating an improved primer for p.S505N detection. METHODS: The 
      W515 amplification employs 5'-labeled allele-specific forward primers to detect 
      p.W515K, p.W515L, p.W515R, and p.W515A. The p.S505N amplification includes an 
      allele-specific reverse primer with a tail extension. Fragments were subject to 
      capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer and analyzed using 
      GeneMapper 6.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RESULTS: Thirty MPL-negative and 13 
      MPL-positive samples previously tested by a reference laboratory were tested with 
      the MPL LDT. Results were 100% concordant. The MPL LDT has a limit of detection 
      of at least 5% VAF for the p.W515 variants and 10% VAF for the p.S505N variant. 
      CONCLUSION: Current MPL assays are predominantly focused on p.W515L/K and p.S505N 
      mutations. We have engineered an MPL test for detecting p.W515A/L/K/R and p.S505N 
      variants, thereby increasing the diagnostic yield with little additional expense 
      or technician time.

TI  - Classification of small lesions on dynamic breast MRI: Integrating dimension 
      reduction and out-of-sample extension into CADx methodology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: While dimension reduction has been previously explored in computer 
      aided diagnosis (CADx) as an alternative to feature selection, previous 
      implementations of its integration into CADx do not ensure strict separation 
      between training and test data required for the machine learning task. This 
      compromises the integrity of the independent test set, which serves as the basis 
      for evaluating classifier performance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We propose, 
      implement and evaluate an improved CADx methodology where strict separation is 
      maintained. This is achieved by subjecting the training data alone to dimension 
      reduction; the test data is subsequently processed with out-of-sample extension 
      methods. Our approach is demonstrated in the research context of classifying 
      small diagnostically challenging lesions annotated on dynamic breast magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The lesions were dynamically characterized 
      through topological feature vectors derived from Minkowski functionals. These 
      feature vectors were then subject to dimension reduction with different linear 
      and non-linear algorithms applied in conjunction with out-of-sample extension 
      techniques. This was followed by classification through supervised learning with 
      support vector regression. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 
      (AUC) was evaluated as the metric of classifier performance. RESULTS: Of the 
      feature vectors investigated, the best performance was observed with Minkowski 
      functional 'perimeter' while comparable performance was observed with 'area'. Of 
      the dimension reduction algorithms tested with 'perimeter', the best performance 
      was observed with Sammon's mapping (0.84±0.10) while comparable performance was 
      achieved with exploratory observation machine (0.82±0.09) and principal component 
      analysis (0.80±0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The results reported in this study with the 
      proposed CADx methodology present a significant improvement over previous results 
      reported with such small lesions on dynamic breast MRI. In particular, non-linear 
      algorithms for dimension reduction exhibited better classification performance 
      than linear approaches, when integrated into our CADx methodology. We also note 
      that while dimension reduction techniques may not necessarily provide an 
      improvement in classification performance over feature selection, they do allow 
      for a higher degree of feature compaction.

AB  - Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes 
      (MELAS) is a complex group of disorders with multisystem involvement that have a 
      wide range of biochemical and genetic defects. The earliest symptoms of MELAS 
      typically include easy fatigability, muscle weakness, encephalopathy with 
      stroke-like episodes, recurrent headaches and seizures. The pathogenesis of 
      stroke-like episodes manifesting as focal deficits like acute cortical blindness 
      is not fully understood. We present an eight-year-old, right-handed boy with 
      MELAS confirmed by the presence of pathogenic missense variant mutation 
      (mt.3243A>G) presenting with acute intermittent reversible episodes of cortical 
      blindness and Anton-Babinski Syndrome secondary to concurrent occipital lobe 
      seizures captured during video electroencephalography (V-EEG) monitoring, in 
      addition to the neuro-imaging which was not consistent with acute 
      ischemic stroke. This case highlights the importance of the V-EEG monitoring 
      besides clinical testing and radiographic correlation during acute cortical 
      blindness episodes in MELAS as occipital lobe seizures could be a part of the 
      symptomatology.

LID - 10.1177/15569845231199741 [doi]
AB  - Left ventricular masses are rare entities that often require surgical excision 
      when diagnosed due to the risk of embolization. We report 2 separate patients 
      presenting with evidence of cerebral embolization both of whom were diagnosed 
      with isolated left ventricular masses and underwent surgical excision through a 
      robot-assisted approach. Microscopic pathology revealed a myxoma and hemangioma, 
      respectively. Both cases demonstrate that left ventricular masses can be feasibly 
      excised through a robot-assisted minithoracotomy approach.

TI  - Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of HPV+ Versus 
      HPV- Forms Reveals Distinct Sets of Potentially Actionable Molecular Targets.
LID - 10.1200/PO.19.00406 [doi]
LID - PO.19.00406
AB  - PURPOSE: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC) encompasses two predominant 
      variants: one associated with detectable high-risk strains of human 
      papillomavirus (hrHPV) and a second form often occurring in the context of 
      chronic dermatitis in postmenopausal women. Genomic assessment of a large-scale 
      cohort of patients with aggressive vSCC may identify distinct mutational 
      signatures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor samples from a total of 280 patients 
      with vSCC underwent hybridization capture with analysis of up to 406 
      cancer-related genes. Human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences were detected by de 
      novo assembly of nonhuman sequencing reads and aligned to the RefSeq database. 
      Immunohistochemistry for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was assessed. RESULTS: 
      One hundred two of 280 vSCCs (36%) contained hrHPV sequences, predominantly HPV 
      16 (88%). The HPV-positive (HPV+) group was significantly younger (median age, 59 
      v 64 years; P = .001). Compared with HPV-negative (HPV-) vSCCs, HPV+ tumors 
      showed more frequent pathogenic alterations in PIK3CA (31% v 16%; P = .004), PTEN 
      (14% v 2%; P < .0001), EP300 (14% v 1%; P < .0001), STK11 (14% v 1%; P < .0001), 
      AR (5% v 0%; P = .006), and FBXW7 (10% v 3%; P = .03). In contrast, HPV- vSCCs 
      showed more alterations in TP53 (83% v 6%; P < .0001), TERTp (71% v 9%; P < 
      .0001), CDKN2A (55% v 2%; P < .0001), CCND1 amplification (22% v 2%; P < .0001), 
      FAT1 (25% v 4%; P < .0001), NOTCH1 (19% v 6%; P = .002), and EGFR amplification 
      (11% v 0%; P < .0001), as well as a higher rate of 9p24.1 (PDL1/PDL2) 
      amplification (5% v 1%) and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry high-positive tumor 
      staining (33% v 9%; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive molecular profiles of 
      vSCC vary considerably with hrHPV status and may inform patient selection into 
      clinical trials. Sixty-one percent of HPV+ vSCCs had a pathogenic alteration in 
      the PI3K/mTOR pathway, whereas HPV- vSCCs showed alterations in TP53, TERTp, 
      CDKN2A, CCND1, and EGFR, and biomarkers associated with responsiveness to 
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Gene expression profile analysis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells reveals 
      upregulation of cadherin genes in myocardial infarction patients.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) induced by acute coronary arterial occlusion is 
      usually secondary to atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Dysregulated response of 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerotic plaques may promote 
      plaque rupture. Cadherins (CDHs) form adherens junctions and are known 
      stabilizers of atherosclerotic plaques. To date, the expression patterns of 
      cadherin have not been well investigated in MI aortic VSMCs. We aimed to 
      investigate the expression of cadherin genes in the aortic wall of patients with 
      and without MI. Laser capture microdissected VSMCs were obtained from aortic 
      tissue samples of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
      Integrative bioinformatic analysis of the microarray profiles of the VSMCs 
      revealed that MI is discriminated at the whole transcriptome level by hundreds of 
      differentially expressed genes, including genes involved in cell adhesion, of 
      which the cadherin superfamily genes were among the top structural category. 
      Eleven significantly deregulated candidates of the cadherin superfamily were 
      chosen and formed a new classifier that collectively discriminated MI vs. non-MI 
      with ~95% accuracy. Significance validation was performed with an independent 
      cohort by quantitative RT-quantitative PCR, confirming overexpression of CDH2, 
      CDH12, PCDH17, and PCDH18 in MI VSMCs. The dysregulation of these cadherin 
      superfamily genes might be related to an MI-induced remote effect on aortic wall 
      VSMCs and to imbalances in signaling pathways and myocardial repair mechanisms. 
      Although pathophysiological significance of our findings requires functional 
      studies, mRNA upregulation of the identified cadherin superfamily members in 
      VSMCs might be associated with the progression of atherosclerosis and 
      angiogenesis activation in MI.

TI  - Benchmarking of deep neural networks for predicting personal gene expression from 
      DNA sequence highlights shortcomings.
PG  - 2060-2064

AB  - Deep learning methods have recently become the state of the art in a variety of 
      regulatory genomic tasks(1-6), including the prediction of gene expression from 
      genomic DNA. As such, these methods promise to serve as important tools in 
      interpreting the full spectrum of genetic variation observed in personal genomes. 
      Previous evaluation strategies have assessed their predictions of gene expression 
      across genomic regions; however, systematic benchmarking is lacking to assess 
      their predictions across individuals, which would directly evaluate their utility 
      as personal DNA interpreters. We used paired whole genome sequencing and gene 
      expression from 839 individuals in the ROSMAP study(7) to evaluate the ability of 
      current methods to predict gene expression variation across individuals at varied 
      loci. Our approach identifies a limitation of current methods to correctly 
      predict the direction of variant effects. We show that this limitation stems from 
      insufficiently learned sequence motif grammar and suggest new model training 
      strategies to improve performance.

TI  - Individual identity information persists in learned calls of introduced parrot 
      populations.

AB  - Animals can actively encode different types of identity information in learned 
      communication signals, such as group membership or individual identity. The 
      social environments in which animals interact may favor different types of 
      information, but whether identity information conveyed in learned signals is 
      robust or responsive to social disruption over short evolutionary timescales is 
      not well understood. We inferred the type of identity information that was most 
      salient in vocal signals by combining computational tools, including supervised 
      machine learning, with a conceptual framework of "hierarchical mapping", or 
      patterns of relative acoustic convergence across social scales. We used 
      populations of a vocal learning species as a natural experiment to test whether 
      the type of identity information emphasized in learned vocalizations changed in 
      populations that experienced the social disruption of introduction into new parts 
      of the world. We compared the social scales with the most salient identity 
      information among native and introduced range monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) 
      calls recorded in Uruguay and the United States, respectively. We also evaluated 
      whether the identity information emphasized in introduced range calls changed 
      over time. To place our findings in an evolutionary context, we compared our 
      results with another parrot species that exhibits well-established and 
      distinctive regional vocal dialects that are consistent with signaling group 
      identity. We found that both native and introduced range monk parakeet calls 
      displayed the strongest convergence at the individual scale and minimal 
      convergence within sites. We did not identify changes in the strength of acoustic 
      convergence within sites over time in the introduced range calls. These results 
      indicate that the individual identity information in learned vocalizations did 
      not change over short evolutionary timescales in populations that experienced the 
      social disruption of introduction. Our findings point to exciting new research 
      directions about the robustness or responsiveness of communication systems over 
      different evolutionary timescales.

AB  - Genomic regulatory elements active in the developing human brain are notably 
      enriched in genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism 
      spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. However, 
      prioritizing the specific risk genes and candidate molecular mechanisms 
      underlying these genetic enrichments has been hindered by the lack of a single 
      unified large-scale gene regulatory atlas of human brain development. Here, we 
      uniformly process and systematically characterize gene, isoform, and splicing 
      quantitative trait loci (xQTLs) in 672 fetal brain samples from unique subjects 
      across multiple ancestral populations. We identify 15,752 genes harboring a 
      significant xQTL and map 3,739 eQTLs to a specific cellular context. We observe a 
      striking drop in gene expression and splicing heritability as the human brain 
      develops. Isoform-level regulation, particularly in the second trimester, 
      mediates the greatest proportion of heritability across multiple psychiatric 
      GWAS, compared with eQTLs. Via colocalization and TWAS, we prioritize biological 
      mechanisms for ~60% of GWAS loci across five neuropsychiatric disorders, nearly 
      two-fold that observed in the adult brain. Finally, we build a comprehensive set 
      of developmentally regulated gene and isoform co-expression networks capturing 
      unique genetic enrichments across disorders. Together, this work provides a 
      comprehensive view of genetic regulation across human brain development as well 
      as the stage-and cell type-informed mechanistic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric 
      disorders.

TI  - Clonal Somatic Mutations in Chronic Lung Diseases Are Associated with Reduced 
      Lung Function.
PG  - 1196-1205
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202303-0395OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Constantly exposed to the external environment and mutagens such as 
      tobacco smoke, human lungs have one of the highest somatic mutation rates among 
      all human organs. However, the relationship of these mutations to lung disease 
      and function is not known. Objectives: To identify the prevalence and 
      significance of clonal somatic mutations in chronic lung diseases. Methods: We 
      analyzed the clonal somatic mutations from 1,251 samples of normal and diseased 
      noncancerous lung tissue RNA sequencing with paired whole-genome sequencing from 
      the Lung Tissue Research Consortium. We examined the associations of somatic 
      mutations with lung function, disease status, and computationally deconvoluted 
      cell types in two of the most common diseases represented in our dataset, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 29%) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; 
      13%). Measurements and Main Results: Clonal somatic mutational burden was 
      associated with reduced lung function in both COPD and IPF. We identified an 
      increased prevalence of clonal somatic mutations in individuals with IPF compared 
      with normal control subjects and individuals with COPD independent of age and 
      smoking status. IPF clonal somatic mutations were enriched in disease-related and 
      airway epithelial-expressed genes such as MUC5B in IPF. Patients who were MUC5B 
      risk variant carriers had increased odds of developing somatic mutations of MUC5B 
      that were explained by increased expression of MUC5B. Conclusions: Our 
      identification of an increased prevalence of clonal somatic mutation in diseased 
      lung that correlates with airway epithelial gene expression and disease severity 
      highlights for the first time the role of somatic mutational processes in lung 
      disease genetics.

AB  - Here, we present a 22-year-old female patient with adult-onset Still's disease 
      (AOSD) who was newly diagnosed in the setting of secondary macrophage activation 
      syndrome (MAS), a rare, life-threatening inflammatory disease with 50% mortality 
      due to multi-organ failure. She met the diagnostic criteria of AOSD and MAS, 
      while genetic testing excluded primary causes of MAS. She had high fevers, 
      anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, hematophagocytosis, and elevated serum 
      ferritin (37,950 ng/mL) and CD25 levels (11,870 pg/mL), which remained 
      unresponsive to corticosteroids and anakinra. Her serum interferon gamma (IFN-γ) 
      levels were elevated (7 pg/mL). She was markedly responsive to IFN-γ blockade 
      with emapalumab that eliminated her fevers and all MAS-associated laboratory 
      abnormalities. This report provides initial evidence for therapeutic efficacy for 
      IFN-γ blockade in AOSD and secondary MAS.

TI  - Classification of usual interstitial pneumonia in patients with interstitial lung 
      disease: assessment of a machine learning approach using high-dimensional 
      transcriptional data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive fibrotic lung disease 
      that distorts pulmonary architecture, leading to hypoxia, respiratory failure, 
      and death. Diagnosis is difficult because other interstitial lung diseases have 
      similar radiological and histopathological characteristics. A usual interstitial 
      pneumonia pattern is a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is essential 
      for its diagnosis. We aimed to develop a molecular test that distinguishes usual 
      interstitial pneumonia from other interstitial lung diseases in surgical lung 
      biopsy samples. The eventual goal of this research is to develop a method to 
      diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without the patient having to undergo 
      surgery. METHODS: We collected surgical lung biopsy samples from patients with 
      various interstitial lung diseases at 11 hospitals in North America. Pathology 
      diagnoses were confirmed by an expert panel. We measured RNA expression levels 
      for 33 297 transcripts on microarrays in all samples. A classifier algorithm was 
      trained on one set of samples and tested in a second set. We subjected a subset 
      of samples to next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) generating expression 
      levels on 55 097 transcripts, and assessed a classifier trained on RNAseq data by 
      cross-validation. FINDINGS: We took 125 surgical lung biopsies from 86 patients. 
      58 samples were identified by the expert panel as usual interstitial pneumonia, 
      23 as non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 16 as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 
      four as sarcoidosis, four as respiratory bronchiolitis, two as organising 
      pneumonia, and 18 as subtypes other than usual interstitial pneumonia. The 
      microarray classifier was trained on 77 samples and was assessed in a test set of 
      48 samples, for which it had a specificity of 92% (95% CI 81-100) and a 
      sensitivity of 82% (64-95). Based on a subset of 36 samples, the RNAseq 
      classifier had a specificity of 95% (84-100) and a sensitivity of 59% (35-82). 
      INTERPRETATION: Our results show that the development of a genomic signature that 
      predicts usual interstitial pneumonia is feasible. These findings are an 
      important first step towards the development of a molecular test that could be 
      applied to bronchoscopy samples, thus avoiding surgery in the diagnosis of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. FUNDING: Veracyte.

AB  - The Emergency Response Operations Management (EROM) Literature Sample is a 
      collection of 644 papers winnowed from over 5,000 related articles through 
      application of a binary classification tree, collecting the state-of-the-art in 
      decision models of emergencies in progress. References are scraped from each of 
      these 644 publications, to create a dataset describing a total of 14,821 papers 
      linked by 23,175 citation relationships, the analysis of which is presented in, 
      "Modeling Emergency Response Operations: A Theory Building Survey" in Computers 
      and Operations Research[1]. Bibliographic research communities are identified 
      within the data set by framing the task of network partitioning as a cluster 
      ensemble problem from machine learning [2]. This data may be used in several 
      ways, including as an extended reference section for [1], as all 644 papers 
      studied could not be individually cited there. Other examples of potential reuse 
      are further study of a particular research cluster, comparative study of the 
      structural characteristics of this bibliographic network with literature in other 
      fields, and as a test-bed for the further development of robust clustering 
      algorithms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with unfavorable carcinoma of unknown primary origin (CUP) 
      have an extremely poor prognosis of ∼1 year or less, stressing the need for more 
      tailored treatments, which are currently being tested in clinical trials. CUPISCO 
      (NCT03498521) was a phase II randomized study of targeted therapy/cancer 
      immunotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously 
      untreated, unfavorable CUP, defined as per the European Society for Medical 
      Oncology guidelines. We present a preliminary, descriptive molecular analysis of 
      464 patients with stringently diagnosed, unfavorable CUP enrolled in the CUPISCO 
      study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic profiling was carried out on 
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue to detect genomic alterations and assess 
      tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability. RESULTS: Overall, ∼32% of 
      patients carried a potentially targetable genomic alteration, including PIK3CA, 
      FGFR2, ERBB2, BRAF(V600E), EGFR, MET, NTRK1, ROS1, and ALK. Using hierarchical 
      clustering of co-mutational profiles, 10 clusters were identified with specific 
      genomic alteration co-occurrences, with some mirroring defined tumor entities. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal the molecular heterogeneity of patients with 
      unfavorable CUP and suggest that genomic profiling may be used as part of 
      informed decision-making to identify the potential primary tumor and targeted 
      treatment options. Whether stringently diagnosed patients with unfavorable CUP 
      benefit from targeted therapies in a similar manner to those with matched known 
      primaries will be a key learning from CUPISCO.

TI  - White matter abnormalities in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: preliminary associations 
      with the Nogo-66 receptor gene and symptoms of psychosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze white 
      matter tractography in the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), fornix, 
      and uncinate fasciculus (UF) of individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 
      controls. Aberrations in these tracts have been previously associated with 
      schizophrenia. With up to 25% of individuals with 22q11.2DS developing 
      schizophrenia in adulthood, we hypothesized reduction in structural integrity of 
      these tracts, including an association with prodromal symptoms of psychosis. We 
      further predicted an association between allelic variation in a functional 
      polymorphism of the Nogo-66 receptor gene and 22q11.2DS white matter integrity. 
      METHODS: Tractography was conducted using fiber assignment by streamline tracking 
      algorithm in DTI Studio. Subjects were genotyped for the rs701428 SNP of the 
      Nogo-66 receptor gene, and assessed for presence of prodromal symptoms. RESULTS: 
      We found significant group differences between 22q11.2DS and controls in DTI 
      metrics for all three tracts. DTI metrics of ALIC and UF were associated with 
      prodromal symptoms in 22q11.2DS. Further, ALIC DTI metrics were associated with 
      allelic variation of the rs701428 SNP of the Nogo-66 receptor gene in 22q11.2DS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in DTI metrics suggest white matter microstructural 
      anomalies of the ALIC, fornix, and UF in 22q11.2DS. Structural differences in 
      ALIC appear to be associated with the Nogo-66 receptor gene, which has been 
      linked to myelin-mediated axonal growth inhibition. Moreover, the association 
      between psychosis symptoms and ALIC and UF metrics suggests that the Nogo-66 
      receptor gene may represent a susceptibility gene for psychosis through its 
      disruption of white matter microstructure and myelin-associated axonal growth.

AB  - Common genetic variants located in calcium channel genes are important markers of 
      genetic susceptibility for bipolar disorder (BD). Previous clinical trials with 
      Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) medication improved mood stability for some BD 
      patients. We hypothesize that manic patients who carried calcium channel risk 
      variants would differentially benefit from treatment with CCBs. In this pilot 
      study, 50 BD patients (Chinese: 39; US: 11) who were hospitalized for manic 
      episodes were given add-on CCB treatment. We determined genotypes for each 
      patient. There was a significant decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
      after add-on medication treatment. Of note, two intronic variants of the Calcium 
      Voltage-Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 B (CACNA1B) were associated with treatment 
      outcomes for manic patients: rs2739258 and rs2739260. BD rs2739258/rs2739260 
      AG-allele carriers had a better treatment response with add-on CCB than those 
      carrying the AA or GG genotypes by survival analysis. Although these findings did 
      not pass multiple testing correction, this study suggests that single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) residing in calcium channel genes could be predictors for 
      response to add-on CCB treatment of bipolar mania patients, and that calcium 
      channel genes may be involved in treatment responses for BD.

TI  - Snapshots of Nature-Based Recreation Across Rural Landscapes: Insights from 
      Geotagged Photographs in the Northeastern United States.
PG  - 234-248
LID - 10.1007/s00267-022-01728-2 [doi]
AB  - Nature-based recreation is of increasing economic importance to rural communities 
      transitioning away from traditional natural resource extraction. Rural areas are 
      rich in cultural ecosystem services (CES) that function as essential public 
      goods, providing benefits to livelihoods and fostering conservation of large 
      landscapes. Geotagged photographs from social media platforms capture detailed 
      information on public use of natural areas that can be useful for stakeholders 
      interested in promoting resilient social-ecological systems, but applications of 
      such "big data" are often limited in either spatiotemporal or thematic scope. We 
      integrated multiple aspects of crowdsourced image data to better understand 
      human-environment interactions, focusing on the Northern Forest, a culturally and 
      ecologically significant region of the northeastern United States. Images for the 
      region were mined from Flickr, a crowdsourcing image platform, from 2012 to 2017 
      and assigned themes via a neural network-cluster analysis pipeline while 
      geographic drivers of nature-based visitor engagement were assessed with random 
      forest models to predict use of CES across the Northern Forest. Daily and 
      seasonal patterns in photography were broadly consistent throughout the region, 
      whereas annual photography trends were more variable. Eleven core themes were 
      identified in images, with 70% of photographs depicting activities related to 
      CES. Visitor engagement with nature was greater near roads and shorelines, and at 
      higher elevations, reflecting tensions between accessibility and aesthetics for 
      recreation. Automated image classification tools can rapidly extract relevant 
      information from crowdsourced photography for exploring human-environment 
      interactions, but researchers should consider multiple spatial and temporal 
      scales in CES assessments of large social-ecological systems.

TI  - Molecular Targets in Salivary Gland Cancers: A Comprehensive Genomic Analysis of 
      118 Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma Tumors.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11020519 [doi]
LID - 519
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Salivary gland carcinomas (SGC) are histologically diverse cancers 
      and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify key molecular targets is an 
      important aspect in the management of advanced cases. METHODS: DNA was extracted 
      from paraffin embedded tissues of advanced SGC and comprehensive genomic 
      profiling (CGP) was carried out to evaluate for base substitutions, short 
      insertions, deletions, copy number changes, gene fusions and rearrangements. 
      Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated on approximately 1.25 Mb. Some 324 
      genes in the FoundationOne CDX panel were analyzed. RESULTS: Mucoepidermoid 
      carcinoma (MECa) mutations were assessed. CDKN2A and CDKN2B GA were common in 
      mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MECa) (52.5 and 30.5%). PIK3CA was also common in MECa 
      (16.9%). ERBB2 amplification/short variants (amp/SV) were found in MECa (5.9/0%). 
      HRAS GA was common in MECa (14.4%) as well. Other targets, including BAP1, PTEN, 
      and KRAS, were noted but had a low incidence. In terms of immunotherapy 
      (IO)-predictive markers, TMB > 10 was more common in MECa (16.9%). PDL1 high was 
      also seen in MECa (4.20%). CONCLUSION: SGC are rare tumors with no FDA-approved 
      treatment options. This large dataset reveals many opportunities for IO and 
      targeted therapy contributing to the continuously increased precision in the 
      selection of treatment for these patients.

AB  - Mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene have been associated with both cardiac and 
      skeletal muscle abnormalities. Cardiac manifestations in LMNA cardiomyopathy have 
      a variable age of onset and range from mild to life-threatening. We describe a 
      case series illustrating manifestations of LMNA mutation in a single family with 
      an extensive history of cardiac disease, including sudden cardiac death, and the 
      implications for diagnosis and management. This discussion highlights potential 
      presentations of LMNA mutations and the importance of genetic testing in patients 
      with a family history of conduction abnormalities.

TI  - Starting to Talk at Age 10 Years: Lessons About the Acquisition of English Speech 
      Sounds in a Rare Case of Severe Congenital But Remediated Motor Disease of 
      Genetic Origin.
PG  - 1029-1038
LID - 10.1044/2019_AJSLP-18-0156 [doi]
AB  - Purpose This study was conducted to observe speech development in a child whose 
      onset of oral communication was extremely delayed. In rare cases, children are 
      born with physical limitations that temporarily interfere with speech sound 
      production. Whether the development of speech sound production follows the same 
      trajectory as that in typical children at younger ages is not well understood. 
      Method We present a child who was wheelchair-bound and communicated nearly 
      exclusively via augmentative and alternative communication devices due to severe 
      congenital motor disease and generalized hypotonia. At age 10 years, her 
      condition improved dramatically with medication after a mutation in a 
      dopamine-related gene was discovered, and she switched entirely to oral 
      communication. Observation of speech development was based on chart reviews, 
      video recordings, and direct testing at age 15 years. Results At age 4 years, the 
      participant's attempts at speech showed a small phoneme inventory consisting of 
      early-acquired phonemes and large numbers of common phonological processes. 
      Following the medical intervention at age 10 years, mastery of velars occurred 
      after age 12 years and mastery of liquids was still incomplete at age 15 years. 
      Conclusions Findings are consistent with general growth trends in speech sound 
      acquisition that are independent of chronological age. Theoretical considerations 
      regarding the role of motor control in the invariant order of speech sound 
      acquisition are posited, specifically regarding articulatory building blocks. 
      Clinical recommendations include interprofessional management of children with 
      complex motor disease and referrals to genetics professionals in the care of such 
      children.

AB  - Testicular teratomas may present in both prepubertal and adult men; however, the 
      prognosis differs greatly between these 2 populations. In children, teratomas 
      (prepubertal type) most often occur before the age of 4, are generally seen in 
      their pure form, and behave in a benign fashion. In adults (postpubertal type), 
      teratomas are usually part of a mixed germ cell tumor, and they have the 
      potential to be found at metastatic sites, especially following chemotherapy for 
      non-teratomatous germ cell tumor. Analyses of metastases from germ cell tumors 
      and teratomas from the same patient have demonstrated a high degree of 
      concordance in the observed genetic abnormalities. In rare cases, testicular 
      teratoma can transform into a malignant germ cell tumor. One such type of 
      transformation is into a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. These tumors are 
      malignant and often metastasize to the retroperitoneum but may also metastasize 
      to other sites. A multimodal treatment approach is needed, including surgery and 
      adjuvant chemotherapy. We describe a rare case of malignant transformation of a 
      testicular teratoma into a primitive neuroectodermal tumor with metastasis to the 
      mediastinum. The patient was treated with radical orchiectomy, retroperitoneal 
      lymph node dissection, and adjuvant vincristine, adriamycin, and cyclofosfamide 
      alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (VAC/IE therapy).

TI  - Outcomes of salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients who had 
      primary focal versus whole-gland ablation: a multicentric study.
PG  - 2995-3003
LID - 10.1007/s11701-023-01738-0 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we present comparative outcomes of radical prostatectomy 
      after whole-gland therapy (wg-SRARP) and focal gland therapy (f-SRARP). The study 
      assessed 339 patients who underwent salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy 
      (SRARP); 145 patients who had primary focal therapy and 194 patients who had 
      primary whole-gland treatment. SRARP was performed in all cases using a 
      standardized technique developed at respective institutes with the da Vinci Xi 
      Surgical System. Our primary endpoint was the comparison of the functional and 
      oncological outcomes between the groups. Cox proportional hazard was used to 
      study the functional and oncological outcomes. The median total operative time 
      for f-SRARP was 18 min higher than wg-RARP (p < 0.001). Higher rates of 
      nerve-sparing were performed in f-SRARP (focal vs whole gland; bilateral-15.2% vs 
      9.3%; unilateral 49% vs 28.4%; p < 0.001). wg-SRARP had higher rates of ISUP 5 
      (26.3% vs 19.3%; p < 0.001) and deferred ISUP score due to altered pathology 
      (14.8% vs 0.7; p < 0.001), while f-SRARP had higher rates of ISUP 4 (11.7% vs 
      10.7%; p < 0.001) and ≥ pT3a (64.8% vs 51.6%; p < 0.001). Positive margins were 
      significantly higher with f-SRARP (26.2% vs 10.3%; p < 0.001). Functional 
      outcomes were poor in both the groups. However, postoperative continence was 
      higher and faster in patients who had f-SRARP compared to wg-SRARP (69% vs. 
      54.6%; p = 0.013). We could not identify statistically significant difference in 
      postoperative potency recovery and biochemical recurrence. We present the largest 
      multi-institutional analyses of f-SRARP and wg-SRARP. SRARP is challenging 
      wherein patients have adverse pathological features and increased surgical 
      complexity irrespective of the primary treatment. Focal therapy group had higher 
      rates of nerve-sparing, however, with increased positive surgical margins. Both 
      groups had poor functional outcomes regardless of nerve-sparing degree, 
      indicating significant ipsilateral and contralateral damage to tissues 
      surrounding the prostate during primary treatment. We believe that this analysis 
      is crucial for counseling patients regarding expected outcomes before performing 
      a salvage treatment following ablative therapy failure.

TI  - Prevalence of targetable genomic alterations in young women with advanced breast 
      cancer: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 181-185
LID - 10.1007/s10549-023-07179-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Approximately 5% of breast cancers each year are diagnosed in young 
      women < 40 years who tend to have worse clinical outcomes. We compared genomic 
      alterations using comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of tumor tissue among 
      very young women (< 30 years) and young women (30-39 years) compared to 
      women ≥ 40 years at diagnosis. METHODS: 2049 advanced breast cancer cases were 
      submitted to Foundation Medicine within a 22-month window for CGP. Hybrid-capture 
      based CGP was performed to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations. Tumor 
      mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and 
      microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. Immunocyte PD-L1 
      expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Of the total cases, 
      28 (1.37%) were < 30 years, 159 (7.76%) were 30-39 years, and 1862 (90.87%) were 
      ≥ 40 at time of diagnosis. Breast tumors were less likely to be estrogen receptor 
      positive in younger women (54% of < 30 years, p > 0.05; 60% of 30-39 years, 
      p < 0.001; 69.4% of ≥ 40 years) and more likely to be triple negative (43%, 
      p = 0.05; 33%, p = 0.05; 26.1% respectively). Young women had higher rates of 
      BRCA1 mutations (17.9% <30 years, p < 0.001; 10.1% 30-39 years, p < 0.001; 2.6% 
      ≥40 years), but lower rates of CDH1 (7.1% <30 years, p > 0.05; 5.0% 30-39 years, 
      p < 0.001; 15.4% ≥40 years) and PIK3CA mutations (17.9% <30 years, p = 0.02; 
      17.6% 30-39 years, p < 0.001; 40.0% ≥40 years). CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      contribute to the growing literature demonstrating unique genetic profiles among 
      young women diagnosed with breast cancer, compared to older women.

AB  - While RNA expression appears to be altered in several brain disorders, the 
      constraints of postmortem analysis make it impractical for well-powered 
      population studies and biomarker development. Given that the unique molecular 
      composition of neurons are reflected in their extracellular vesicles (EVs), we 
      hypothesized that the fractionation of neuron derived EVs provides an opportunity 
      to specifically profile their encapsulated contents noninvasively from blood. To 
      investigate this hypothesis, we determined miRNA expression in microtubule 
      associated protein 1B (MAP1B)-enriched serum EVs derived from neurons from a 
      large cohort of individuals with schizophrenia and nonpsychiatric comparison 
      participants. We observed dysregulation of miRNA in schizophrenia subjects, in 
      particular those with treatment-resistance and severe cognitive deficits. These 
      data support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in 
      posttranscriptional regulation of synaptic gene expression and provides an 
      example of the potential utility of tissue-specific EV analysis in brain 
      disorders.

AB  - Land cover/land use (LCLU) maps are essential inputs for environmental analysis. 
      Remote sensing provides an opportunity to construct LCLU maps of large geographic 
      areas in a timely fashion. Knowing the most accurate classification method to 
      produce LCLU maps based on site characteristics is necessary for the environment 
      managers. The aim of this research is to examine the performance of various 
      classification algorithms for LCLU mapping in dry and humid climates (from June 
      to August). Testing is performed in three case studies from each of the two 
      climates in Iran. The reference dataset of each image was randomly selected from 
      the entire images and was randomly divided into training and validation set. 
      Training sets included 400 pixels, and validation sets included 200 pixels of 
      each LCLU. Results indicate that the support vector machine (SVM) and neural 
      network methods can achieve higher overall accuracy (86.7 and 86.6%) than other 
      examined algorithms, with a slight advantage for the SVM. Dry areas exhibit 
      higher classification difficulty as man-made features often have overlapping 
      spectral responses to soil. A further observation is that spatial segregation and 
      lower mixture of LCLU classes can increase classification overall accuracy.

TI  - Accelerometer-based predictions of behaviour elucidate factors affecting the 
      daily activity patterns of spotted hyenas.

AB  - Animal activity patterns are highly variable and influenced by internal and 
      external factors, including social processes. Quantifying activity patterns in 
      natural settings can be challenging, as it is difficult to monitor animals over 
      long time periods. Here, we developed and validated a machine-learning-based 
      classifier to identify behavioural states from accelerometer data of wild spotted 
      hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), social carnivores that live in large fission-fusion 
      societies. By combining this classifier with continuous collar-based 
      accelerometer data from five hyenas, we generated a complete record of activity 
      patterns over more than one month. We used these continuous behavioural sequences 
      to investigate how past activity, individual idiosyncrasies, and social 
      synchronization influence hyena activity patterns. We found that hyenas exhibit 
      characteristic crepuscular-nocturnal daily activity patterns. Time spent active 
      was independent of activity level on previous days, suggesting that hyenas do not 
      show activity compensation. We also found limited evidence for an effect of 
      individual identity on activity, and showed that pairs of hyenas who synchronized 
      their activity patterns must have spent more time together. This study sheds 
      light on the patterns and drivers of activity in spotted hyena societies, and 
      also provides a useful tool for quantifying behavioural sequences from 
      accelerometer data.
